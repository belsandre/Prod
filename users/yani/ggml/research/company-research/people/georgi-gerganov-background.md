- **Timeline Gaps**: Exact dates of education, project starts, company founding unclear
- **Secondary Sources**: Most information from third-party descriptions, not primary
- **Personal Life**: No information about personal circumstances, family, etc.

### Biases
- **Success Focus**: Sources emphasize achievements, not setbacks or challenges
- **Public Persona**: Information limited to publicly visible activities
- **Technical Bias**: Focus on technical achievements, less on business/management
- **Recency Bias**: Emphasis on recent projects (llama.cpp, ggml.ai)

### Verification Status
- ✅ Education (physics/medical physics) mentioned in multiple sources
- ✅ University (Sofia University) verified
- ✅ Major projects (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, ggml) verified through GitHub
- ✅ Company founding (ggml.ai) verified through official website
- ✅ Funding (Friedman/Gross) verified through multiple sources
- ⚠️ Timeline details (exact graduation dates, career progression) not specific
- ❌ Previous employment history not documented
- ❌ Personal background details not available

### Inconsistencies
- None identified - limited information is consistent across sources
- Some sources may refer to different people with same name (noted in search results)
- Medical University profile appears to be different Georgi Gerganov
