## Source Priority Assessment

### High Priority Sources (All Documented)
1. ✅ GGML GitHub repository - Primary technical source
2. ✅ ggml.ai website - Primary company source
3. ✅ Georgi Gerganov GitHub profile - Primary founder source
4. ✅ llama.cpp repository - Key ecosystem project
5. ✅ HuggingFace article - Technical education

### Medium Priority Sources (Referenced)
6. ✅ Web search results on funding
7. ✅ Web search results on founder background
8. ⚠️ LinkedIn profiles (limited access)
9. ⚠️ Changelog podcast (referenced but not fully extracted)

### Lower Priority Sources (Not Pursued)
- Twitter/X posts (ephemeral, low objectivity)
- Reddit discussions (anecdotal, low objectivity)
- Blog posts (scattered, variable quality)
- News articles (limited coverage found)

**Rationale**: Focused on high-objectivity primary sources (GitHub, official docs) supplemented with educational content. Commercial/business information limited due to private company status.

---

## Information Gaps Identified

### Business Information
- ❌ Funding amount and valuation
- ❌ Revenue numbers and growth rate
- ❌ Customer count and names
- ❌ Team size and composition
- ❌ Exact company founding date
- ❌ Detailed pricing for enterprise support

### Market Information
- ❌ Actual download/deployment numbers
- ❌ Market share vs. competitors
- ❌ Independent performance benchmarks
- ❌ Analyst reports or market studies
- ❌ Production deployment case studies

### Founder Information
- ❌ Career history before GGML projects
- ❌ Prior employers or positions
- ❌ Management experience
- ❌ Detailed educational timeline

### Technical Information
- ⚠️ Performance benchmarks (limited)
- ⚠️ Detailed backend comparison
- ⚠️ Production-scale testing results

**Why These Gaps Exist**:
- Private company (no filing requirements)
- Early stage (limited public disclosure)
- Technical project (limited press coverage)
- Founder focused on code (limited public presence)

**Impact on Research Quality**:
- HIGH confidence in technical assessment (code is public)
- MEDIUM confidence in business assessment (limited data)
- Can assess technical capability well, commercial viability less well

## Critical Evaluation Framework Applied

### Source Objectivity Levels

**High Objectivity** (3 sources):
- GitHub repositories (verifiable metrics, transparent code)
- Technical documentation (factual, verifiable)

**Medium Objectivity** (2 sources):
- HuggingFace educational content (balanced, third-party)
- Professional profiles (self-curated but verifiable)

**Low Objectivity** (1 source):
- Company website (promotional, selective)

### Key Questions Asked
1. ✅ Are technical claims verifiable through code? YES
2. ✅ Do statistics align across sources? YES
3. ✅ Is funding information confirmed by multiple sources? YES
4. ✅ Are there inconsistencies between sources? NO
5. ✅ What information is suspiciously absent? Business metrics
6. ✅ Can achievements be independently verified? YES (GitHub)

### Red Flags Assessment
- ✅ No inconsistencies detected
- ✅ No contradictory information
- ⚠️ Limited business disclosure (yellow flag, but expected for stage)
- ⚠️ Founder concentration risk (yellow flag, but common)
- ✅ No evidence of misleading claims
