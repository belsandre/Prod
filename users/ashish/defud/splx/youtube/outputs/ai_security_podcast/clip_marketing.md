## Clip 1: The Cybersecurity Professor Witch Experiment

### Extended Description (72 words)
Sandy Dun reveals a fascinating 3-year longitudinal study tracking AI bias evolution. By running the same DALL-E prompt every six months, she discovered that adding "cybersecurity" to "professor" transformed the generated image from attractive to witch-like, exposing deep-seated bias in AI training data. Over time, the images became neutral and average, raising questions about whether sanitized AI outputs represent progress or loss of authenticity.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
AI thinks cybersecurity experts look like witches. 🧙‍♀️ Sandy Dun's 3-year experiment with DALL-E shows how bias hides in plain sight. Should AI makers decide what's "offensive"? 🤔

#AIBias #MachineLearning #TechEthics #CyberSecurity #AIResearch #DALLE #TechTok

**LinkedIn:**
SPLX's Sandy Dun ran a simple experiment that reveals the complex problem of AI bias. For three years, she's tested how DALL-E visualizes "cybersecurity professors." The results evolved from overtly biased (witch-like) to carefully neutral (average everything). This raises a critical question for enterprises: are we outsourcing cultural decisions to model makers?

**Twitter/X:**
Sandy Dun tested DALL-E for 3 years with the same prompt. Adding "cybersecurity" turned the professor into a witch. Now it's sanitized to "average everything." Who's really making cultural decisions here? 🧙‍♀️➡️🧑‍🏫

## Clip 2: The Gasoline Factory Analogy

### Extended Description (68 words)
SPLX's Sandy Dun delivers a stark warning to enterprises rushing AI adoption: layering AI onto broken digital infrastructure is dangerous and counterproductive. Organizations with poor asset management, scattered data catalogs, and unpatched systems are amplifying risk, not reducing it. Before deploying AI, companies must fix foundational issues. The gasoline factory metaphor captures the explosive potential of this common mistake.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
Throwing AI on broken systems = lighting a match in a gasoline factory 🔥 Stop. Fix your infrastructure first. Here's why ⬇️

#AIStrategy #DigitalTransformation #TechLeadership #EnterpriseAI #CyberSecurity #TechTips

**LinkedIn:**
If your organization can't maintain a clean data catalog or track third-party dependencies, AI will amplify those weaknesses exponentially. Sandy Dun from SPLX puts it bluntly: it's like lighting a match in a gasoline factory. Before your next AI initiative, audit your fundamentals first.

## Clip 3: The 200-Prompt Test

### Extended Description (75 words)
SPLX faced a seemingly simple request: ensure an internal chatbot never leaks conversations between users. The solution? Test the same prompt 200 times. This reveals AI's fundamental difference from traditional software: non-deterministic behavior means you can't assume consistent results. Sandy Dun explains how this changes QA methodology, risk assessment, and what "passing a test" even means when dealing with probabilistic systems.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
Traditional QA: Test once ✅ AI QA: Test 200 times and cross your fingers 🤞 This is why AI security is a whole new game.

#AISecurity #QATesting #SoftwareTesting #MachineLearning #TechEducation #AITesting

**LinkedIn:**
At what point do you call an AI system "secure"? SPLX tested one prompt 200 times to ensure privacy compliance. Traditional software QA doesn't prepare teams for non-deterministic systems where the same input can produce different outputs. This fundamentally changes how we think about testing, validation, and acceptable risk thresholds.

## Clip 4: Prompting in Navajo

### Extended Description (70 words)
Advanced AI attackers use sophisticated techniques: prompting in obscure languages like Navajo, encoding attacks in images, requesting seemingly innocent content like "Tudor dynasty poetry" to bypass guardrails. Sandy Dun explains why static guardrails fail against creative adversaries and why runtime behavioral detection is essential. If your healthcare chatbot suddenly receives Navajo prompts or poetry requests, that's not a user, it's an attack.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
AI hackers are prompting in Navajo and asking for Tudor poetry. No, really. 🎭 Here's why your guardrails won't catch them.

**LinkedIn:**
Threat actors are bypassing AI guardrails using obscure languages, image-encoded prompts, and contextually bizarre requests. SPLX's runtime detection flags anomalies: Why is someone prompting your healthcare chatbot in Navajo? Why ask for Tudor dynasty poetry? Behavioral analysis catches what rule-based systems miss.

Real AI attack techniques:
• Prompting in Navajo
• Encoding in images
• Asking for Tudor poetry

Why? Guardrails can't catch context violations. Runtime detection can.

## Clip 5: Speed Wins Fights (OODA Loop Finale)

### Extended Description (73 words)
Sandy Dun's closing advice distills AI security into one imperative: speed. Drawing on fighter pilot John Boyd's OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), she argues that organizational velocity determines survival. AI has compressed attack timelines from months to hours. Defenders must match that pace by streamlining decision-making, reducing approval friction, and embracing rapid iteration. In the AI dogfight, the fastest decision-maker wins.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
Fighter pilots win dogfights by deciding faster than opponents. 🛩️ Same rules apply to AI security. Speed > perfection. Full breakdown ⬇️

#Leadership #Strategy #AISecurity #BusinessStrategy #OODALoop #TechLeadership #FastDecisions

**LinkedIn:**
John Boyd's OODA loop principle applies to AI security: observe, orient, decide, act—faster than your adversaries. Sandy Dun's parting wisdom challenges every enterprise leader: where are your slow processes costing you competitive advantage? Zero-day exploits now happen in 24 hours. Your decision cycles need to match.
