## Clip 1: "Lighting a Match in a Gasoline Factory"

### Extended Description (65 words)
Sandy Dun has seen too many enterprises rush to deploy AI without fixing fundamental infrastructure problems first. In this clip, she delivers a vivid warning: throwing AI on top of broken digital systems doesn't solve problems, it amplifies them. Before adding AI capabilities, organizations need to step back and ensure their foundation is solid. The consequences of skipping this step can be catastrophic.

### Platform-Specific Variations

**Instagram/TikTok Caption:**
You can't fix broken systems with AI magic. Sandy Dun explains why that's a recipe for disaster.

**LinkedIn Caption:**
Before you deploy AI, ask yourself: Is your digital infrastructure ready? Sandy Dun, 20-year security veteran and OWASP AI security leader, explains why "throwing AI on broken infrastructure is like lighting a match in a gasoline factory." The foundation matters more than the innovation.

**YouTube Shorts Description:**
Sandy Dun explains the #1 mistake enterprises make when deploying AI. With over 20 years in cybersecurity and leadership in OWASP AI security initiatives, Sandy has seen organizations rush to adopt AI without fixing fundamental problems in their infrastructure.

## Clip 2: "Sandy the Dream Killer"

### Extended Description (72 words)
Sandy Dun was on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM project, which meant every AI security startup wanted her feedback on their product. She earned the nickname "Sandy the Dream Killer" for her honest assessments.

## Clip 3: "It's Mathematically Impossible"

### Extended Description (68 words)
In one of the most provocative moments of the conversation, Sandy Dun challenges a fundamental assumption: that organizations can achieve complete AI governance. The attack surface is too vast, she explains. You mathematically cannot understand everything and have the resources to address it. But rather than despair, this realization should free organizations to shift from binary thinking to statistical risk management, making smarter bets rather than chasing impossibilities.

### Platform-Specific Variations

**Instagram/TikTok Caption:**
AI governance is mathematically impossible. But that might actually be good news.

**LinkedIn Caption:**
"As much as people talk about being able to do AI governance, it's mathematically impossible to do it at the core level." Sandy Dun's statement will make some security leaders uncomfortable. But she argues this truth is liberating: it forces us to shift from binary metrics to statistical risk management. Stop pretending you can control everything. Start making smarter bets.

**YouTube Shorts Description:**
Can you actually achieve complete AI governance? According to Sandy Dun, a 20-year cybersecurity veteran and OWASP AI security leader, the answer is no, and that's okay. In this clip from The Def Podcast, Sandy explains why the AI attack surface is mathematically too vast for traditional binary security approaches and why organizations should embrace statistical risk management instead. #AIgovernance #cybersecurity #riskmanagement #CISO

## Clip 4: "Using the Model vs. Attacking the Model"

### Extended Description (70 words)
Most AI security conversations focus on prompt injection and model attacks. But Sandy Dun reveals the uncomfortable truth: that's not where adversaries are focusing. Why would they? They can use AI to find zero days, do recon, and generate exploit code at unprecedented speed. The "sexy" story is attacking the model. The real threat is attackers using models to compress their entire attack cycle against traditional infrastructure.

### Platform-Specific Variations

**Instagram/TikTok Caption:**
Everyone's worried about the wrong AI threat. Here's where attackers are actually focused.

**LinkedIn Caption:**
"Attacking the model may seem sexy and lucrative, but using the model for doing traditional attacks is sexier." Sandy Dun reframes the AI security narrative: attackers aren't targeting your AI models. They're using AI to find zero days in 24 hours instead of months. The threat isn't new attack vectors. It's old attacks moving at AI speed.

**YouTube Shorts Description:**
What's the real AI security threat? It's not what most people think. Sandy Dun, 20-year cybersecurity veteran and member of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM project, explains why attackers aren't focused on hacking AI models. They're using AI to accelerate traditional attacks. Zero days that used to take months to exploit now take 24 hours. The threat model has changed. #AIsecurity #cybersecurity #threatintelligence #zerodayexploit

## Clip 5: "Speed Is Everything"

### Extended Description (67 words)
In her closing advice, Sandy Dun delivers a powerful call to action: the biggest change with AI is speed, and organizations that can't match it will lose. She references John Boyd's OODA loop, developed for fighter pilots who knew that the fastest decision-maker wins the fight. Every process across your organization needs to answer one question: How do we do this more quickly?

### Platform-Specific Variations

**Instagram/TikTok Caption:**
Fighter pilots know: fastest decisions win fights. Same rule applies to AI security.

**LinkedIn Caption:**
"Recognize that the biggest change with AI is speed." Sandy Dun's closing advice references John Boyd's OODA loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. Fighter pilots who decide fastest win dogfights. Organizations that can't make security decisions at AI speed will be left behind. Look at every process and ask: How do we do this more quickly?

**YouTube Shorts Description:**
