# Short Clip Segments - Seidman Episode (David Seidman)

## Clip 1: Jobs Already Being Eliminated

**Timestamps:** [00:23:24 - 00:23:45]
**Duration:** 21 seconds
**Platform:** LinkedIn/Twitter

**Clip Title:** "I Didn't Hire SOC Analysts Because of AI"

**Key Quote:**
> "If this was 2015, I would probably have had to hire some SOC analysts for Plaid, but because there is an AI option now, I have not hired those people, and it doesn't look like we're going to need to."

**Full Transcript Segment:**
"And I think that's going to be great for the people who are able to remain in this field. It will… I think it will eliminate a large number of jobs. I mean, right now, if this was 2015, I would probably have had to hire some SOC analysts for Plaid, but because there is an AI option now, I have not hired those people, and it doesn't look like we're going to need to. So, I think there are already jobs being eliminated in the SOC vertical, and I think that that is going to accelerate..."

**Why It Works:**
Brutally honest admission from a security leader about job displacement happening TODAY, not in the future. No sugarcoating. This will generate massive discussion and shares. Everyone in security operations will want to comment.

**Suggested Caption:**
SOC analyst jobs aren't being eliminated in the future. They're being eliminated now. Plaid's security leader explains why he didn't hire analysts he would have hired in 2015. 💼

## Clip 2: Detection Is Not Very Good

**Timestamps:** [00:10:29 - 00:11:00]
**Duration:** 31 seconds
**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Clip Title:** "The Open Secret of Security Detection"

**Key Quote:**
> "The open secret of detection today is that it's just really not very good. Even very mature organizations frequently fail to detect their red team."

**Full Transcript Segment:**
"And so, I think that our field is going to be completely transformed and will be nearly unrecognizable in a few years, and much more effective than it is today. And I think the open secret of detection today is that it's just really not very good. Even very mature organizations frequently fail to detect their red team. They never detect all the techniques the red team uses. They rarely detect all the techniques a real attacker uses if they detect even one of them. So, we're not very good at detection and response in industry, and I think that AI could potentially change that at a very fundamental level."

**Why It Works:**
Security leader admitting what everyone knows but nobody says publicly. Validates widespread frustration. Creates credibility and opens conversation about why AI matters. Confession + hope = engagement.

**Suggested Caption:**
Even the most mature security teams fail to detect their own red team. Plaid's security leader on why threat detection is broken and how AI might actually fix it. 🎯

## Clip 3: 30 to 60 Minutes Becomes 30 Seconds

**Timestamps:** [00:06:29 - 00:07:00]
**Duration:** 31 seconds
**Platform:** LinkedIn/Twitter

**Clip Title:** "AI SOC: From 60 Minutes to 30 Seconds"

**Key Quote:**
> "It's taking a task that might take a human 30 to 60 minutes to perform and shrinking it down to a 30-second review of what the AI investigated."

**Full Transcript Segment:**
"But it… it is taking a task that might perform a human 30 to 60... or it might take a human 30 to 60 minutes to perform. And… shrinking it down to a 30-second review of what the AI investigated, and it's already run all the queries you might think to run. And it doesn't really matter very much if it makes a mistake here or there, because it's overall pretty robust. So that technology is, like, basically here today."

**Why It Works:**
Concrete before/after transformation with specific numbers. Easy to understand ROI. Shows AI delivering on the promise RIGHT NOW, not in the future. Shocking time compression that everyone can visualize.

**Suggested Caption:**
Security alert triage: 60 minutes → 30 seconds. Plaid's security leader on AI SOC tools working in production today. The technology is here. ⚡

## Clip 4: The Vulnerability Cataclysm

**Timestamps:** [00:36:01 - 00:36:49]
**Duration:** 48 seconds
**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Clip Title:** "The Coming Fire Drill on an Industry-Wide Scale"

**Key Quote:**
> "If AI can discover all the vulnerabilities and exploit them very quickly, we're going to have a fire drill on an industry-wide scale. And then after that, we'll have many fewer vulnerabilities."

**Full Transcript Segment:**
"The publicly available vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and attack orchestration tooling is improving very rapidly, and there's quite a bit of evidence developing that AIs are very able to find new vulnerabilities, turn them into exploits, turn exploits into attack campaigns with relatively low skill on the person running the tools... those folks I mentioned have predicted that this will eventually lead to widespread exploitation of new zero-day vulnerabilities, and potentially catastrophic consequences for the industry... I think there's a very real chance that they're right... If we get to a place where AI can discover all the vulnerabilities and exploit them very quickly, we're going to have a fire drill on an industry-wide scale, and everyone is going to have to scramble to fix all of these vulnerabilities. And then after that, we'll have many fewer vulnerabilities."

**Why It Works:**
Scary but credible prediction from serious practitioner. Cites real researchers (Bruce Schneier, Heather Adkins). Paints vivid picture of coming crisis. Creates urgency. Sparks debate about timeline and impact.

**Suggested Caption:**
When AI makes finding and exploiting zero-days trivial, we'll face an industry-wide fire drill. David Seidman (Plaid) on the vulnerability cataclysm that security researchers are warning about. 🚨

## Clip 5: Defenders Have a Lead Time

**Timestamps:** [00:39:20 - 00:39:35]
**Duration:** 15 seconds
**Platform:** Twitter/LinkedIn

**Clip Title:** "We Have a Lead. For How Long?"

**Key Quote:**
> "Tools that make it easy for anyone to find and exploit a vulnerability are not widely available, so we have a little bit of lead time as defenders. Could be years, could be months, could be days."

**Full Transcript Segment:**
"The good news is, right now, vulnerability code review tools are widely available, and AI vulnerability discovery tools are not widely available. I should say, tools that make it easy for anyone to find and exploit a vulnerability are not widely available, so we have a little bit of lead time as defenders. I don't know how long we have. Could be years, could be months, could be days."

**Why It Works:**
Creates immediate tension and urgency. Quantifies the unknown ("years, months, or days"). Makes abstract threat feel imminent. Perfect length for viral sharing. Leaves audience wanting more context.

**Suggested Caption:**
Defenders have a temporary lead before AI exploitation tools become widely available. How long? Years, months, or days. Nobody knows. ⏰
