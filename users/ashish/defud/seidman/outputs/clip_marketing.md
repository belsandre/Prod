## Clip 1: Jobs Already Being Eliminated

### Extended Description (70 words)
In one of the most candid moments about AI's impact on security jobs, David Seidman admits that Plaid didn't hire SOC analysts they would have needed in 2015. Not because of budget constraints or hiring freezes, but because AI SOC tools made those positions unnecessary. This isn't speculation about future job displacement. It's happening today. Security leaders are making staffing decisions based on AI capabilities that already work in production.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
"If this was 2015, I'd have hired SOC analysts. Because of AI, I didn't." Plaid security leader on jobs being eliminated NOW. 💼 #AI #jobs #cybersecurity

**LinkedIn:**
Job displacement in security operations isn't coming. It's already here. David Seidman, Head of Platform Security at Plaid, on why he didn't hire SOC analysts he would have needed in 2015. AI SOC tools made those positions unnecessary. This is the honest conversation about AI nobody wants to have.

**YouTube Shorts:**
"If this was 2015, I would have had to hire SOC analysts for Plaid. Because there is an AI option now, I have not hired those people." David Seidman, who spent 20 years in security across Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, Robinhood, and now Plaid, shares the harsh reality: security operations jobs are being eliminated today. Not in the future. This is what AI displacement looks like in practice.

## Clip 2: Detection Is Not Very Good

### Extended Description (68 words)
Security professionals know the dirty secret but rarely admit it publicly: even the best detection programs fail regularly. David Seidman breaks the silence, revealing that mature organizations frequently can't detect their own red teams, let alone real attackers. This validates the frustration that every SOC analyst feels while also explaining why AI matters so much. When your baseline is "really not very good," AI improvements become transformative, not incremental.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
The secret every security team knows but won't admit: threat detection doesn't work well. Even for mature orgs. Plaid security leader tells the truth. 🎯 #cybersecurity #security

**LinkedIn:**
"The open secret of detection today is that it's just really not very good. Even very mature organizations frequently fail to detect their red team." David Seidman (Plaid) on why the industry needs AI to fundamentally transform threat detection, not just incrementally improve it. This admission changes the conversation.

**YouTube Shorts:**
How good is threat detection in cybersecurity? David Seidman, Head of Platform Security at Plaid with 20 years experience across Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, reveals the open secret: even very mature organizations frequently fail to detect their own red team. They never detect all the techniques used. They rarely detect all the techniques a real attacker uses. This is why AI in security isn't just hype. The baseline is broken.

## Clip 3: 30 to 60 Minutes Becomes 30 Seconds

### Extended Description (65 words)
The most concrete demonstration of AI's impact on security operations. Alert triage, a task that traditionally requires 30-60 minutes of analyst time to investigate logs, run queries, and analyze patterns, now takes 30 seconds with AI SOC tools. The AI runs every query a human would think to run, performs analysis, and delivers an accurate summary. This isn't a theoretical improvement. This is working in production POCs today.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
Security alert triage: 60 minutes → 30 seconds. AI SOC tools are already doing this in production. The future is here. ⚡ #AI #cybersecurity #automation

**LinkedIn:**
From 60 minutes to 30 seconds. David Seidman (Plaid) on AI SOC tools that can analyze security alerts, run all relevant queries, and produce accurate summaries in a fraction of the time. The technology isn't coming. It's already working in production. This is what transformation looks like when you measure it.

**YouTube Shorts:**
How fast can AI analyze a security alert? David Seidman, Platform Security lead at Plaid, tested AI SOC tools in production. A task that takes human analysts 30-60 minutes to perform now takes 30 seconds. The AI runs every query you'd think to run, performs effective analysis, and delivers an accurate summary. The most striking part? They saw essentially no instances where the AI came to the wrong conclusion.

## Clip 4: The Vulnerability Cataclysm

### Extended Description (72 words)
The most sobering prediction about AI's impact on cybersecurity. When AI makes finding and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities trivial, the industry faces a catastrophic inflection point. Not speculation from vendors. A warning from researchers like Bruce Schneier and Heather Adkins based on evidence that AI can already discover vulnerabilities, turn them into exploits, and orchestrate attacks with minimal human skill. The fire drill will be industry-wide. Then vulnerabilities become rare.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
When AI makes hacking trivial, we face an industry-wide emergency. Security researchers call it the "vulnerability cataclysm." It's coming. 🚨 #cybersecurity #AI #security

**LinkedIn:**
"If AI can discover all vulnerabilities and exploit them very quickly, we're going to have a fire drill on an industry-wide scale." David Seidman (Plaid) on the vulnerability cataclysm that Bruce Schneier, Heather Adkins, and other security researchers are warning about. This isn't vendor fear-mongering. This is serious practitioners preparing for a potential catastrophe.

**YouTube Shorts:**
The vulnerability cataclysm is coming. David Seidman, Platform Security leader at Plaid, explains what happens when AI makes discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities trivial.

## Clip 5: Defenders Have a Lead Time

### Extended Description (62 words)
The most urgent soundbite from the entire episode. Right now, AI security code review tools are widely available. AI vulnerability discovery and exploitation tools are not. Defenders have a temporary advantage. But the timeline is unknowable. Could be years before exploitation tools proliferate. Could be months. Could be days. Open source models and competitive pressure make it impossible to keep this technology locked down forever.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram/TikTok:**
Defenders have a lead before AI hacking tools go public. Years, months, or days. Nobody knows. ⏰ #cybersecurity #AI #security

**LinkedIn:**
"We have a little bit of lead time as defenders. Could be years, could be months, could be days." David Seidman (Plaid) on the race between AI security tools and AI exploitation tools. Right now, defenders are winning. But open source and competitive pressure mean that lead is temporary. What are you doing with this window?

**YouTube Shorts:**
How long do defenders have before AI exploitation tools become widely available? David Seidman, who leads platform security at Plaid after 20 years at Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and Robinhood, gives the honest answer: Nobody knows. Could be years, months, or days. Security code review tools using AI are widely available today. Tools that make it easy for anyone to find and exploit vulnerabilities are not. Yet. But open source models mean no company can keep this locked down forever. This is the race.
