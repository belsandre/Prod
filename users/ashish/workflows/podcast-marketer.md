**Purpose:** Convert raw podcast transcripts into polished marketing materials that drive audience growth and engagement.

**Best for:** Podcast hosts, marketing teams, and content creators looking to maximize the reach of their podcast episodes.

## Input

### Required:

### Prompt 2: Generate 4 LinkedIn Post Variations

```
You are a skilled social media marketer creating LinkedIn posts to promote a podcast episode. Write from the perspective of the podcast HOST (not the guest).

Your task: Create 4 distinct LinkedIn post variations that will make people want to listen to the episode.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **First sentence MUST be a hook** - something that stops the scroll and makes the reader curious
- **NO em dashes (—)** - use periods, commas, or line breaks instead
- **Host narrative voice** - write as if you (the host) are sharing your experience of the conversation
- **Conversational and authentic** - sound human, not corporate
- **Each post uses a different angle** - vary the approach and theme

MARKETING BEST PRACTICES TO INCORPORATE:
- Lead with value: What will the reader gain?
- Use specific details over vague statements
- Include a compelling question or provocative statement
- Create curiosity gaps (hint at something without fully revealing it)
- Use short paragraphs and line breaks for readability
- End with a clear call-to-action (listen to the episode)
- Incorporate 2-3 relevant hashtags at the end
- Optimal length: 150-250 words

POST STRUCTURE FOR EACH VARIATION:
1. **Hook sentence** - grab attention immediately
2. **Context** - brief setup of who the guest is and why they matter
3. **Key insight or story** - the meat of the post, highlight 1-2 compelling moments
4. **Takeaway** - what the audience can learn or do with this information
5. **Call-to-action** - invite them to listen

VARIATION THEMES (use different angle for each):
- **Variation 1: Personal Story Angle** - Focus on an emotional or transformative moment from the conversation
- **Variation 2: Contrarian/Surprising Angle** - Lead with something unexpected or counterintuitive
- **Variation 3: Practical/Actionable Angle** - Emphasize specific takeaways and lessons
- **Variation 4: Big Picture/Trend Angle** - Connect to larger industry trends or timely topics

Based on your analysis from Prompt 1, here's the key information:
[PASTE OUTPUT FROM PROMPT 1 HERE]

Generate the 4 LinkedIn post variations now, clearly labeled as Variation 1, 2, 3, and 4.
```

**Expected Output:** Four complete, ready-to-post LinkedIn posts, each taking a different marketing angle but all optimized for engagement and click-through.

### Prompt 3: Identify 5 Viral-Worthy Clip Segments

```
You are a social media content strategist identifying the best short-form video clips from a podcast episode.

Your task: Select 5 segments that have the highest viral potential for platforms like Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and LinkedIn video posts.

CLIP SELECTION CRITERIA:
Each clip must be:
- **Under 60 seconds** (ideally 30-45 seconds)

- **Impactful** - delivers one of these:
  * A surprising revelation or counterintuitive insight
  * A punchy, quotable statement
  * An emotionally resonant story or moment
  * A practical tip or actionable advice
  * A bold or controversial opinion

WHAT MAKES A GREAT CLIP:
- Opens strong - grabs attention in first 3 seconds
- Guest speaks clearly and with energy
- Visual interest (if on video) - emotion, gestures, engagement
- Leaves viewers wanting more
- Easily shareable - people will want to send to friends
- Triggers one of: surprise, inspiration, learning, or debate

FOR EACH CLIP PROVIDE:
1. **Start timestamp** (from VTT file)
2. **End timestamp** (from VTT file)
3. **Duration** (in seconds)
4. **Clip title** (5-8 words, punchy and curiosity-driven)
5. **Key quote or hook** (the most impactful line in the segment)
6. **Why it works** (1-2 sentences explaining the viral potential)
7. **Suggested caption** (1-2 sentence caption for social media post)
8. **Target platform** (which platform this clip is best suited for)

Based on your earlier analysis, here's the transcript information:
[PASTE TRANSCRIPT AND PROMPT 1 OUTPUT HERE]

3. **Hashtag Strategy**
   - 5-7 relevant hashtags for each platform
   - Mix of broad (#entrepreneur) and niche (#SaaSgrowth) tags
   - Include trending hashtags if applicable

4. **Content Series Positioning**
   - How this clip fits into a larger content strategy
   - What other clips could be paired with it
   - Potential follow-up content ideas

5. **Testing Variations**
   - 2 alternative hooks/captions to A/B test
   - Different angles to position the same clip

Based on the clips identified in Prompt 3:

## Step 4: Save and Organize Your Content

### File Organization

Create a dedicated folder for each podcast episode:

```

├── linkedin_posts.md          # All 4 post variations
├── clip_segments.md           # 5 clip selections with timestamps
├── clip_marketing.md          # Extended marketing materials for clips
└── analysis.md                # Original analysis from Prompt 1 (for reference)
```

### Content Formatting Tips

**For LinkedIn Posts:**
- Save each variation with clear headers (## Variation 1, ## Variation 2, etc.)
- Include character count for each post
- Add notes about which variation tested best (update after posting)

**For Clip Segments:**
- Format timestamps clearly: [00:12:34 - 00:13:18]
- Include the actual quote text from the transcript
- Add checkboxes to track which clips have been edited and posted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: LinkedIn posts feel too sales-y or promotional**
- Solution: Focus on insights and value first, mention the episode second. Lead with "Here's what I learned..." rather than "Check out my new episode..."

**Problem: Can't find clip-worthy moments in the transcript**
- Solution: Look for:
  - Moments where the guest's energy increases
  - Times when you (the host) react with surprise
  - Practical how-to explanations
  - Personal stories or vulnerable moments
  - Disagreements or debates

**Problem: Hooks feel forced or clickbait-y**
- Solution: Use the "curiosity gap" technique - hint at valuable information without fully revealing it. Example: "The most successful founders do something counterintuitive..." (then explain what)

**Problem: VTT timestamps are inaccurate**
- Solution:
  - Watch/listen to the sections to verify
  - Zoom transcripts can be off by a few seconds
  - Adjust timestamps manually if needed
  - Add buffer (start 2-3 seconds early, end 2-3 seconds late)

**Problem: All 4 LinkedIn variations sound too similar**
- Solution: Force yourself to use different starting points:
  - Start with a question vs. a statement
  - Start with the guest's background vs. a key insight
  - Start with industry context vs. personal story
  - Use different tones (inspirational, educational, provocative, personal)

**Problem: Clips are too long (over 60 seconds)**
- Solution:
  - Find the core 20-30 seconds and add minimal context
  - Cut the setup and start mid-thought if needed
  - End before the full explanation - leave them wanting more
  - Split into two separate clips if both parts are strong

**Problem: Guest mentions competitors or sensitive topics**
- Solution:
  - Select different clip segments that avoid those mentions
  - Edit LinkedIn posts to focus on universal insights rather than specific companies
  - Use generic descriptions ("leading companies" instead of naming competitors)

## Example Outputs

### Example LinkedIn Post (Variation 1 - Personal Story Angle)

**Post:**

Most AI founders are solving the wrong problem.

I just spent an hour with Sarah Chen, who sold her AI startup for $200M to Google, and she completely changed how I think about product development.

Here's what surprised me: She didn't start with the technology. She started by spending 6 months just watching customer support agents do their jobs. No coding. No pitching. Just observing.

What she discovered was that the agents weren't drowning in volume. They were drowning in context switching. Every single ticket required them to check 4-5 different systems just to understand the customer's history.

So instead of building "AI that answers customer questions" (what everyone else was doing), she built "AI that brings all the context together in one place."

The result? Her tool reduced average handle time by 60%. Not because it answered questions, but because it eliminated the busywork around answering questions.

The lesson: The most valuable solutions come from watching people work, not from imagining what they need.

In this week's episode, Sarah breaks down her entire process for finding product-market fit, including the 3 questions she asks in every customer observation session.

Link in comments. Worth your time if you're building anything.

### Example Clip Segment

**Clip 2: The Context Switching Discovery**

- **Start timestamp:** 00:24:15
- **End timestamp:** 00:24:58
- **Duration:** 43 seconds
- **Clip title:** "Why Customer Support Agents Are Really Struggling"
- **Key quote:** "They weren't drowning in volume. They were drowning in context switching."
- **Why it works:** Counterintuitive insight that challenges common assumptions about the customer support problem. Relatable for anyone who works with multiple tools/systems.
- **Suggested caption:** The real problem with customer support isn't what most people think. Sarah Chen (AI founder, $200M exit) explains what she discovered after 6 months of observation. 💡
- **Target platform:** LinkedIn (professional audience, relevant to product builders and operators)

## Advanced Tips

### Getting Better Results

1. **Provide Rich Context:** The more you tell the LLM about your guest, audience, and brand, the better the output. Include:
   - Your podcast's typical listener demographic
   - Your brand voice guidelines
   - Previous successful posts for reference
   - Your goals for this particular episode

2. **Iterate on Hooks:** If the first sentence hooks feel weak, ask for 10 alternative opening lines. Test different approaches:
   - Question format: "What if everything you know about X is wrong?"
   - Provocative statement: "Most people are doing X backwards."
   - Personal observation: "I've interviewed 100 founders. Only 3 did this."
   - Specific detail: "It took Sarah 847 customer observation hours to find this insight."

3. **Customize for Your Voice:** After getting initial output, refine with prompts like:
   - "Make this sound more conversational and less polished"
   - "Add more specific details from the conversation"
   - "Rewrite this with shorter sentences and more energy"
   - "Remove any jargon and make it accessible to non-experts"

4. **Test Clip Pacing:** When selecting clips, read them out loud or time them. Social media clips feel different than they look on paper. What seems punchy in text might feel rushed or slow when spoken.

5. **Seasonal and Trending Connections:** If the episode content relates to current events, trends, or seasonal topics, explicitly mention this in the prompts to get more timely, relevant marketing angles.

### Workflow Variations

**For Video Podcasts:**
- Add visual cues to clip selection (gestures, facial expressions, whiteboard moments)
- Consider thumbnail potential when selecting clips
- Note any visual elements that should be highlighted in captions

**For Multi-Guest Episodes:**
- Create separate LinkedIn posts for moments with different guests
- Tag both guests when relevant
- Select clips that show interesting interactions between guests

**For Technical/Educational Content:**
- Balance accessible hooks with specific technical details
- Create "101" clips for beginners and "advanced" clips for experts
- Use LinkedIn for professional audience, other platforms for broader reach

**For Series or Themed Episodes:**
- Reference previous episodes in the series in LinkedIn posts
- Create compilation clips that show evolution across episodes
- Use consistent hashtags for series discoverability

---

## Notes

- **Turnaround Time:** This workflow typically takes 30-45 minutes to complete once you have the transcript.
- **Batch Processing:** If you have multiple episodes, process them together to maintain consistency.
- **A/B Testing:** Post different LinkedIn variations at different times to see which angle performs best with your audience.
- **Repurposing:** These clips and posts can be repurposed for newsletters, blog posts, and email campaigns.
- **Guest Approval:** Consider sending LinkedIn posts to guests for review before posting, especially if including sensitive company information.
