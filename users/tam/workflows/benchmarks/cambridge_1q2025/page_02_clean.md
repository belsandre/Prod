VENTURE GAPITAL
DISCLAIMER & NOTE TO MANAGERS AS OF MARCH 31, 2025
DISCLAIMER
Our goal is to provide you with the most accurate and relevant performance information possible; as a result, Cambridge Associates’ research
organization continually monitors the constantly evolving private investments space and its fund managers. When we discern material
changes in the structure of an asset class and/or a fund’s investment strategy, it is in the interest of all users of our benchmark statistics that
we implement the appropriate classification realignments.
In addition, Cambridge Associates is always working to grow our private investments performance database and ensure that our benchmarks
are as representative as possible of investors’ institutional-quality opportunity set. As a result we continually add funds to the database (both
newly-raised funds and backfill funds) and occasionally we must remove funds that cease reporting. Our private investments performance
database is dynamic and will reflect both classification adjustments and changes to the underlying pool of contributing funds. As a result, you
may notice quarter to quarter changes in the results of some historical benchmark return analyses.

monitoring database. Should you wish to use a limited portion of these statistics in any presentation materials, you must footnote the source as
