VENTURE CAPITAL
 AS OF MARCH 31, 2025
OVERVIEW
Cambridge Associates’ Private Investments Database is one of the most robust collections of institutional quality private fund performance. It
contains the historical performance records of over 2,400 fund managers and their over 10,000 funds. In addition, we capture the
performance information (gross) of over 99,000 investments underlying our venture capital, growth equity, and buyout funds. This is one of
the largest collections of fund portfolio investment-level performance information in the world and represents the investments of
approximately 65% of these funds on a count basis and 67% on a total commitment basis. This fund and investment-level performance
information is drawn from the quarterly and audited annual financial statements of the fund managers and each manager’s reported
performance numbers are independently recreated from the financial statements and verified by Cambridge Associates.
Institutional Quality Data
Cambridge Associates strives to include only institutional quality funds in our benchmarks. “Institutional quality” funds, in our definition, tend
to meet the following criteria: closed-end funds, commingled funds that invest third party capital (we exclude firms that invest off of their
balance sheet, such as a bank’s principal investing group or a corporate’s venture capital arm), and fund vehicles. This institutional quality
screen seeks to provide investors with performance data consistent with their investible opportunity set.
Sources of Benchmark Data
Our benchmark database utilizes the quarterly unaudited and annual audited fund financial statements produced by the fund managers (GPs)
for their Limited Partners (LPs). These documents are provided to Cambridge Associates by the fund managers themselves. Unlike other data
providers, Cambridge Associates does not use Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or similar requests, regulatory filings, manager surveys, or
press “scrapings” to obtain information. Our goal is to have a complete historical record of the quarterly cash flows and net asset values for all
funds in the benchmarks. We use a number of paths to encourage fund managers to submit their performance data to our database: our
clients for whom we provide private investment performance reporting, our research organization’s regular meetings with thousands of
managers, our special projects designed to enhance existing benchmarks or launch new ones, our exclusive relationships with over ten
globally-diverse fund manager associations, and finally, our strategic relationships with Refinitiv and the Institutional Limited Partners
Association (ILPA). By leveraging these varied sources and proprietary relationships, Cambridge Associates has constructed a rich and
diversified benchmark data set.
Vintage Year Definition
Vintage year is defined as the date of the fund’s first cash flow, defined as the date of the fund’s first LP contribution. Any investment activity
taken prior to the first LP contribution is not taken into account.
