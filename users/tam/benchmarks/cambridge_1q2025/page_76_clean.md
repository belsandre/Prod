VENTURE GAPITAL
DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY AS OF MARCH 31, 2025
Additional Calculation Definitions:
In order to provide meaningful statistics, Cambridge Associates has applied minimum fund count thresholds for each calculation. See
minimum counts in parenthesis after each calculation.
Pooled return aggregates all cash flows and ending NAVs in a sample to calculate a dollar-weighted return. (minimum 3 funds)
Arithmetic mean averages the individual fund IRRs included in a vintage year. (minimum 3 funds)
Median is the middle fund IRR of the group of individual fund IRRs included in a vintage year. (minimum 5 funds)
Equal-weighted pooled return equally weights all cash flows and ending NAVs based on committed capital to calculate a dollar-
weighted return. (minimum 3 funds)
Upper/ lower quartile are the thresholds for the upper (top 25%) and lower (bottom 25%) quartiles based on the individual fund
IRRs included in a vintage year. Can be used in conjunction with the median to determine quartile placement. (minimum 8 funds)
Top 5 percent/ bottom 5 percent are the thresholds for the upper and lower 5*" percentiles based on the individual fund IRRs
included in a vintage year. (minimum 8 funds)
Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of the individual returns. The calculation employs the standard methodology for
calculating a sample mean (not a population mean). (minimum 8 funds)
Realization ratio exhibits (TVPI, DPI, RVPI): CA has independently calculated the proper realization ratio for each fund in each vintage year.
Please note that each fund has been ranked within its respective vintage year by the corresponding realization ratio, as opposed to being
ranked by IRR as they are ranked in the since inception IRR exhibit. As a result a fund's ranking within its vintage year may change. For
example, it is possible that a vintage year can have a different median fund when ranked by IRR vs. when ranked by TVPI, DPI or RVPI.
Cambridge Associates Modified Public Market Equivalent (mPME): The mPME calculation is a private-to-public comparison that seeks to
replicate private investment performance under public market conditions. The public index’s shares are purchased and sold according to the
private fund cash flow schedule, with distributions calculated in the same proportion as the private fund, and the mPME NAV (the value of the
shares held by the public equivalent) is a function of mPME cash flows and public index returns. The mMPME attempts to evaluate what return
would have been earned had the dollars been deployed in the public markets instead of in private investments while avoiding the “negative
NAV” issue inherent in some PME methodologies. “Value-Add” shows (in basis points) the difference between the actual private investment
return and the mPME calculated return.
Exhibits detailing data for portfolio companies are grouped by year of the fund’s initial investment in a company, as opposed to vintage year.
Returns are gross returns.
