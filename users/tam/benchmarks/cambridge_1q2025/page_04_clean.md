VENTURE CAPITAL
TIMING OF FINAL BENCHMARKS AND DATA EVOLUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 2025
The Cambridge Associates’ benchmarks are reported on a one-quarter lag from the end of the performance quarter due to the reporting time
frame of private investments fund managers.
Published Data: When the vast majority of a benchmark group’s (organized by asset class, e.g. Venture Capital or Real Estate) performance
information is updated for a performance quarter, that benchmark is considered final and the data is “published” via the quarterly benchmark
reports.
Changes to Data: After a benchmark group is published, any updates to historical data for these funds, which can include adding a fund and its
performance history to the database (“backfills”) and/or updating past information for an existing fund due to late-arriving, updated, or
refined information, would be reflected when that group is published for the next performance quarter.
In addition, Cambridge Associates may change the classification of certain funds; this often driven by the evolution of private investments and
the resulting need to introduce new benchmarks or refine our classification scheme. For example, as growth equity emerged as an asset class
we reclassified certain venture capital and buyout funds accordingly.
Survivorship Bias: In order to track the performance of a fund in our benchmarks, we require the complete set of financial statements from
the fund’s inception to the most current reporting date. When an active fund stops providing financial statements, we reach out to the
manager and make several attempts to encourage them to continue to submit their data. We may, during this communication period, roll
forward the fund’s last reported quarter’s net asset value (NAV) for several quarters. When we are convinced that the manager will not
resume reporting to us, the fund’s entire performance history is removed from the database.
When fund managers stop reporting before their fund’s return history is complete, an element of “survivorship bias” may be introduced to a
performance database, which could skew the reported returns upwards if the funds dropping out had poorer returns than those funds that
remained. Survivorship bias can affect all investment manager databases, including those for public stock managers and hedge funds.
Compared to public stocks and hedge funds, however, the illiquid nature of private investments can actually help limit this survivorship effect.
Whereas an underperforming stock manager may simply close up shop or drop out of databases as clients liquidate their positions and fire the
manager, private investment partnerships owning illiquid assets continue to exist and require reporting to the limited partners, even if the
original manager ceases to exist.
Over the last ten years the number of fund managers that stopped reporting to Cambridge Associates before liquidation represented an
average of 0.8% (per year) of the total number of funds in the database during the respective year, and an average of 0.6% (per year) asa
percentage of total NAV in the database during that respective year. During that same period the overall number of funds in our database
increased by an average of 7% (per year). The performance of the small number of funds that have stopped reporting has been spread
amongst all quartiles and has not been concentrated consistently in the poorer performing quartiles.
