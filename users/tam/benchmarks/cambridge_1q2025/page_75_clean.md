VENTURE CAPITAL
DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY AS OF MARCH 31, 2025
Cambridge Associates LLC (CA) has established a database to monitor investments made by venture capital and other alternative asset
partnerships. Users of the analysis may find the following description of the data sources and calculation techniques helpful to their
interpretation of information presented in the report:
Partnership financial statements and narratives are the primary source of information concerning cash flows and ending residual/ net asset
values (NAV) for both partnerships and portfolio company investments.
Recognizing the alternative asset community's sensitivity to the distribution of information pertaining to individual fund investments, as a
matter of policy CA only releases aggregated figures in its benchmark report.
Vintage year is defined as the date of the fund’s first cash flow, defined as the date of the fund’s first LP contribution. Any investment activity
taken prior to the first LP contribution is not taken into account.
CA uses both the since inception internal rate of return and the end-to-end or horizon performance calculation in its benchmark reports:
The since inception internal rate of return (SI IRR) is a since inception calculation that solves for the discount rate, which makes the
net present value of an investment equal to zero. The calculation is based on cash-on-cash returns over equal periods modified for the
residual value of the partnership’s equity or portfolio company’s NAV. The residual value attributed to each respective group being
measured is incorporated as its ending value. Transactions are accounted for on a quarterly basis, and annualized values are used for
reporting purposes. Please note that all transactions are recorded on the 45th day or midpoint of the quarter.
Cambridge Associates uses the end-to-end or horizon internal rate of return calculation to calculate the official quarterly, annual, and
multi-year index figures. The horizon IRR performance calculation is a money-weighted return similar to the since inception IRR;
however, it is measuring performance between two points in time. The calculation incorporates the beginning NAV (if any, treated as
an inflow), interim cash flows and the ending NAV (if any, treated as an outflow). All interim cash flows are recorded on the mid-period
date of the quarter. In order for a fund to be included in a horizon IRR calculation, the fund must have at least one quarterly
contribution, distribution or NAV during the time frame being measured. Similar to the since inception IRR, the horizon IRR is
annualized for time frames greater than one year.
