## GP Mentions (Hyperion GPs: Dillon, Henry)

**Search Status**: ✅ Completed in Phase 1C (November 12, 2025)

**Dillon Dunteman**: No mentions found across all research materials (research-summary.md, source files)

**Henry Bellew**: No mentions found across all research materials

**Analysis**: No documented GP testimonials or relationships. Given major discrepancy (expected $60M-$100M GM deal did not materialize), recommend urgent discussion with Hyperion GPs to verify investment thesis, GM relationship status, and current company assessment.



## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: GM Deal Not Materialized

**DATAROOM CLAIMS** (September 15, 2022 entry):
- Entry valuation: $12M post-money
- Investment: $25,000
- **Expected raise: $60M-$100M minimum in Q1 '24**
- **"GM signing $60m-$100m commitment"**

**PUBLIC REALITY** (2024-2025):
- December 2024: $4.4M convertible note (NOT $60M-$100M)
- **NO EVIDENCE of GM partnership, investment, or commitment**
- Total funding: $11.3M across all rounds (2018-2024)
- Company still actively fundraising

**DISCREPANCY MAGNITUDE**:
- **93% shortfall**: $4.4M vs. $60M-$100M projected
- **Timeline miss**: Q1 '24 → Dec '24, much smaller raise
- **GM deal**: No public evidence whatsoever

**POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS**:
1. GM deal fell through or never materialized
2. EV market slowdown impacted battery startup funding
3. Dataroom projections were aspirational, not confirmed
4. Private deal not announced (highly unlikely for $60M-$100M)

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Urgent**: Verify GM relationship status and actual investment details with Hyperion.

## Executive Summary

Natrion is a U.S.-based solid-state battery technology company (founded 2018) developing LISIC (Lithium Solid Ionic Composite) electrolyte technology for EVs and energy storage. The company has raised $11.3M total, including $2M seed (2022, Mark Cuban) and $4.4M convertible note (Dec 2024).

**Key Strengths**:
- Manufacturing-compatible technology (no factory retooling needed)
- Strong government validation (Air Force contracts >$1.5M, DoD support)
- Industry recognition (2024 Edison Award, Forbes 30U30)
- Tier-1 investor (LG Technology Ventures)
- Commercial product launch (taking orders for Gen-1 separator)
- Multiple U.S. facilities (NY, IL)

**Major Concerns**:
- **Critical**: Expected $60M-$100M GM deal did not materialize
- Raised only $4.4M in 2024 vs. $60M-$100M projection
- Total funding ($11.3M) insufficient for battery manufacturing scale
- Still fundraising 2+ years after Hyperion investment
- Highly competitive market (QuantumScape $1.3B raised, Solid Power $600M+)
- No named customers or production volume data

**Investment Status**: High risk - major catalyst (GM deal) did not occur, funding trajectory well below expectations.

## Areas for Further Research

### URGENT
1. **GM Relationship Status**: What happened to projected $60M-$100M deal?
2. **Actual Investment Terms**: Verify Hyperion's Sept 2022 investment details
3. **Current Valuation**: What is fair value given funding shortfall?

### High Priority
4. **LG Relationship**: Investor only, or also customer/partner? Investment size?
5. **Customer Pipeline**: Who is buying Gen-1 separators? Volume? Revenue?
6. **Manufacturing Readiness**: Pilot vs. commercial scale? Capacity?
7. **Follow-On Plans**: Series A timing, target size, lead interest?

## Investment Thesis Assessment

**Original Thesis** (Per Dataroom):
- Early battery technology play
- GM $60M-$100M commitment as validation
- Q1 '24 major raise expected

**Current Reality**:
- ❌ GM deal did not materialize
- ❌ Major raise did not occur ($4.4M vs. $60M-$100M)
- ✅ Technology progressing (product launch, awards)
- ✅ Government validation (Air Force contracts)
- ⚠ Undercapitalized for manufacturing scale
- ⚠ Highly competitive market with better-funded players

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH**
- Capital requirements likely $100M-$500M+ for commercial manufacturing
- Current funding ($11.3M total) insufficient
- GM catalyst failure major blow
- EV/battery market headwinds
- Strong competition from well-funded rivals

**Recommendation**: **Flag for revaluation** - Major expected catalyst (GM deal) did not occur. Assess current fair value, downside protection, and whether to support in follow-on vs. writedown.

## Source Quality Analysis

### Medium-High Objectivity (1)
- 2024 Funding Updates (PitchBook, Crunchbase, industry news)

### Medium Objectivity (1)
- Mark Cuban Seed Funding (Press release, verifiable investors)

### Low Objectivity (1)
- Company Website (promotional, company-controlled)

**Overall**: Medium quality - sufficient for funding verification, limited for traction validation

---


## Conclusion

Natrion has legitimate technology with government validation and is progressing toward commercialization. **However, the critical GM partnership/investment that was projected to provide $60M-$100M did NOT materialize**, leaving the company significantly undercapitalized for battery manufacturing at scale.

The December 2024 $4.4M convertible note (93% below projection) indicates challenging fundraising environment and/or company-specific issues. While technology awards and Air Force contracts provide validation, the absence of the GM deal fundamentally changes the investment thesis.

**Urgent action needed**: Verify GM relationship status and reassess fair value given major catalyst failure.
