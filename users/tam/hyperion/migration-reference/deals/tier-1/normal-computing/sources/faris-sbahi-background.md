**Source Type**: Professional Profiles (LinkedIn, Google Scholar, Personal Website)

**Objectivity Level**: Medium

**Reliability Assessment**: LinkedIn and Google Scholar are self-reported but generally accurate for professional credentials. Credentials can be cross-verified with Duke University records and Google/X employment. Personal website appears outdated (lists him as undergraduate when he's now CEO).

### Personal Attributes (from founder testimonial in dataroom)
Dillon Dunteman's assessment: "Faris Sbahi, CEO & Co-Founder, Normal ($17M Series A raise): 'Dillon is a rare investor who combines founder-first tact with genuine deep technical insight, including a principled view of new-era business models and growth. Dillon embodies grit – and ultimately grit and character is what founders respect most. When we needed hands the most, Dillon was there, clearing his weekend to help on strategy, talent, and other critical initiatives for my company. I believe that the best investors feel they perpetually need to earn their right to win. Dillon has a right to win in deeptech and will continue to cement that advantage over other investors. He will always be one of my first phone calls when raising a new round.'"

### Leadership & Company Building
- Raised $8.5M seed (January 2023) then expanded to $35M total
- Built team of ~30 FTEs spanning 4 global offices (NYC, SF, London, Copenhagen)
- Successfully executed on thermodynamic chip tape-out (CN101, August 2025)
- Secured partnerships/pilots with Fortune 500 semiconductor companies
- Landed investment from major strategic investors (Micron Ventures, Samsung Next, Intel Ignite)

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Exceptionally strong technical credentials (triple major, valedictorian, quantum computing expertise)
- Top-tier work experience (Google X, Google Brain frameworks)
- Successful fundraising track record ($35M seed)
- Strong operational execution (4 global offices, CN101 tape-out)
- Respected by sophisticated technical investors (Dillon Dunteman)

**Limitations**:
- Relatively young CEO (graduated ~2018-2020, so approximately 26-28 years old)
- Limited prior CEO/leadership experience before founding Normal Computing
- First-time founder
- No prior company exits in background
- Commercial traction not independently verified (Fortune 500 pilot claims)

**Biases**:
- LinkedIn profiles are self-reported
- Founder testimonial is highly promotional
- Personal website may be outdated

**Verification Status**:
- Duke University credentials: Verifiable through alumni records
- Google X/Google Brain employment: Verifiable through Google Scholar collaborations and TensorFlow Probability/Quantum contributions
- CEO of Normal Computing: Verified through press releases
- Fundraising success: Verified through PR Newswire announcements
- Age/experience level: Inferred not confirmed

**Notable Gaps**:
- Exact graduation year not confirmed
- Specific role/responsibilities at Google X unclear
- Commercial track record limited (first company)
- No information on previous startups, exits, or operating experience at scale

## Assessment

Faris Sbahi presents as an exceptionally technically credentialed founder with deep expertise in quantum computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. His background from Google X and contributions to major ML frameworks (TensorFlow Probability/Quantum) suggest serious technical

 depth.

However, as a first-time founder who is relatively young (likely late 20s), he lacks prior entrepreneurial exits or experience scaling companies to $100M+ revenue. The strong testimonial from Dillon Dunteman suggests good founder-investor relationship and receptiveness to help.

**Key Strengths for Investor**: Technical depth, quantum/AI expertise, academic pedigree, Google X credibility, strong fundraising ability

**Key Risks**: First-time founder, young, unproven commercial operator, no exits, customer traction unverified
