## Key Information

### Education
- **Johns Hopkins University, Whiting School of Engineering**
  - B.S. in Electrical Engineering (2021)
  - M.S. in Robotics (2022)

### Professional Experience

**Current (2023-Present)**: Founder & CEO, Dirac, Inc.
- Founded in 2023
- Develops BuildOS platform for automated manufacturing work instructions
- Based in Empire State Building, NYC
- Raised $10.7M seed from Founders Fund and Coatue

**Previous Roles**:
- **Northrop Grumman** (Hardware Engineer, May 2021 - September 2021)
  - Entry-level hardware engineering role
  - Manufacturing and production experience
  - 4-5 months tenure
  - Joined in 2020 per some sources, worked through 2021

- **MIT Lincoln Laboratory** (Research roles, timing unclear)

### Motivation for Founding Dirac
Drawing from firsthand experience at Northrop Grumman, Fil was motivated by legacy infrastructure and workflows in production that needed modernization. Observed manual, time-consuming work instruction creation process firsthand.

### Personal Attributes (from founder testimonial in dataroom)
Dillon Dunteman's assessment:
> "Dillon has been incredible to have on our team. He is sharp, mission-aligned, and deeply cares about helping the founders that he works with win. His insights and perspective have been something that I've come to value and lean on while building Dirac, and I'd recommend working with Dillon to any founder I know."

### Age/Experience Level
- Graduated undergrad in 2021, masters in 2022
- Founded company in 2023 (1 year post-graduation)
- Likely 25-26 years old currently (2025)
- First-time founder

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Strong technical credentials (Johns Hopkins EE + Robotics)
- Domain expertise from Northrop Grumman manufacturing experience
- Identified real customer pain point from firsthand observation
- Successfully raised $10.7M from top-tier VCs (Founders Fund, Coatue)
- Secured strategic Siemens partnership
- Receptive to investor guidance per Dillon testimonial

**Limitations**:
- Very young (25-26 years old)
- First-time founder with no prior exits
- Limited professional experience (1 year at Northrop before founding)
- Entry-level role at Northrop (Hardware Engineer, not senior position)
- Short Northrop tenure (4-5 months)
- No prior leadership or management experience before CEO role

**Biases**:
- Professional profiles are self-reported
- Founder testimonial is promotional (though from trusted source)
- Limited public information may indicate deliberate privacy

**Verification Status**:
- Johns Hopkins degrees: Verifiable through alumni records
- Northrop Grumman employment: Verifiable through LinkedIn
- MIT Lincoln Lab: Mentioned but details unclear
- Founder/CEO of Dirac: Verified through multiple press releases and company website
- Fundraising success: Verified through PR announcements

**Assessment**:
Fil is a domain expert founder who identified a real problem from firsthand experience. Strong technical background (robotics, electrical engineering) gives credibility. However, he is very early in his career with limited operating experience.

Key success factors will be:
1. Building experienced commercial team around him
2. Being coachable and receptive to investor/advisor guidance (Dillon testimonial suggests this is true)
3. Scaling beyond initial pilot customers to production deployments
4. Executing on Siemens partnership for distribution

The strong testimonial from Dillon ("sharp", "mission-aligned", "deeply cares", "value and lean on") combined with successful fundraising from sophisticated investors (Trae Stephens/Founders Fund) suggests Fil is a high-potential founder despite youth and limited experience.

**Key Risk**: First-time founder in mid-20s with <1 year of work experience before founding. Success depends on surrounding himself with experienced operators and being coachable.
