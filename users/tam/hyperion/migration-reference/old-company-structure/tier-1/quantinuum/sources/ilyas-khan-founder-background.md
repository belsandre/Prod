## Context: Relationship with Dillon Dunteman

**From Hyperion Dataroom - Founder Testimonial**:

Ilyas Khan on Dillon (6 years ago = March 2019-2020):
> "When I first met Dillon 6 years ago, he demonstrated extensive technical understanding of the quantum computing industry and our differentiated position in the market — better than all of the major venture firms that I spoke with during our fundraise process. Dillon has continued to hold strategic conversations with myself and other leaders on my team. He has also provided valuable guidance to other quantum startups that I am close with, with those founders speaking very highly of him."

**Timeline Alignment**:
- Dillon at Firmament: January 2019 - January 2021
- Quantinuum (then Cambridge Quantum) investment: March 2020
- Ilyas Khan met Dillon: ~2019-2020 (matches "6 years ago" from 2025-2026)
- Testimony indicates ongoing relationship through 2025

**Relationship Quality Indicators**:
- Technical respect (Dillon understood quantum computing deeply)
- Comparative endorsement (better than major VCs)
- Ongoing engagement (continued strategic conversations)
- Network value (guidance to other quantum startups Ilyas knows)
- Peer respect (other founders speak highly)

## Assessment for VC Research

**Founder Quality**: ★★★★★ (Exceptional)

**Strengths as Founder**:
1. **Rare Combination**: Merchant banking + deep tech (commercial acumen + technical credibility)
2. **Long-Term Vision**: 11-year journey (2014 founding to 2025 Helios launch)
3. **Execution Track Record**: Cambridge Quantum grown to strategic merger, Quantinuum scaled to $10.6B
4. **Strategic Relationships**: Cambridge academic ecosystem, Honeywell corporate partnership, enterprise customers
5. **Industry Leadership**: Recognized voice, foundation chairman roles, thought leadership

**Considerations**:
1. **CEO Transition**: No longer day-to-day CEO (transitioned to Dr. Rajeeb Hazra)
2. **Honeywell Control**: 54% ownership by Honeywell may limit founder independence
3. **Age**: 63 years old (born 1962) - succession planning relevant for long-term

**Investor Perspective**:
- Strong founder testimonial of Dillon indicates genuine relationship (not transactional)
- Ongoing strategic conversations (6+ years) show sustained value-add
- Network effects (Ilyas connecting Dillon to other quantum startups)
- Technical respect from non-technical founder rare and valuable
