## Conclusion

Haiqu represents a strategically aligned quantum software investment that fits Hyperion's deeptech thesis and Dillon's domain expertise. The founding team has strong technical credentials, and the $4M pre-seed round from high-quality investors (MaC VC, Toyota Ventures, SOMA Capital) validates the opportunity.

**However, a critical data discrepancy exists**: dataroom claims differ significantly from public funding records, which must be resolved before proceeding with any investment analysis or decision-making.

**If the investment is actually the 2023 pre-seed (most likely scenario)**: The company is now 2+ years post-funding, and follow-on opportunity depends on:
1. Commercial progress since 2023 (limited public evidence)
2. Series A readiness and timing (unclear)
3. Valuation progression (unknown)
4. Quantinuum relationship value delivered

**If there was an unreported 2025 seed round (less likely)**: This would represent a significant commercialization milestone, but absence of public announcement is unusual for $10M round.

**Recommended Classification**: Maintain as Tier 2 "Up-and-Comer" but **flag for data verification** before considering follow-on investment or portfolio valuation assumptions.
