## Executive Summary

Marathon Fusion is a San Francisco-based fusion infrastructure company (founded 2023) developing tritium fuel processing technology critical for commercial fusion power plants. The company raised $5.9M seed (July 2024, 1517 Fund + Anglo American lead) and secured $10.9M total funding including ARPA-E grants. Marathon has Letters of Intent with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Helion Energy.

**Technology**: High-throughput metal foil superpermeation pumps for tritium extraction/recycling, enabling fusion plants to operate with reduced tritium inventory and improved economics.

**Breakthrough**: Nuclear transmutation discovery - method to convert mercury into gold as fusion plant byproduct (5,000 kg gold/year per 1 GW plant, $500M+ annual value).

**Key Strengths**:
- ✅ Strong founder credentials (Adam Rutkowski: ex-SpaceX propulsion + Princeton plasma physics PhD; Kyle Schiller: ex-Schmidt Futures)
- ✅ Tier-1 customer validation (LOIs with Commonwealth Fusion, Helion - $2.6B+ raised combined)
- ✅ Critical infrastructure play (tritium bottleneck blocks fusion commercialization)
- ✅ Exceptional team (10 PhDs, ex-SpaceX/Helion/TAE/Princeton PPL/Tesla)
- ✅ Strong backing (1517 Fund, Anglo American, ARPA-E, Breakthrough Energy)
- ✅ Dual revenue model (tritium systems + gold transmutation adds $500M/plant)

**Key Concerns**:
- ⚠ **Extremely early stage**: Founded 2023, technology still in development
- ⚠ **Fusion market risk**: Commercial fusion delayed 5-10+ years (customer timing uncertainty)
- ⚠ **Untested at scale**: Superpermeation validated in labs, not commercial fusion plants
- ⚠ **Gold transmutation**: Simulation-only, not experimentally validated
- ⚠ **Capital requirements**: Will need $20M-$50M Series A for pilot manufacturing
- ⚠ **Small seed round**: $5.9M insufficient for hardware development at scale

**Investment Thesis**: Marathon has identified critical fusion infrastructure bottleneck (tritium supply) and secured validation from leading fusion companies ($2.6B+ raised). Strong technical team with fusion industry experience. Gold transmutation (if proven) could double fusion plant economics. However, extremely early stage with unproven technology and dependence on fusion industry timeline (5-10+ years to commercialization).

## Technology & Product

**Core Product**: High-throughput tritium fuel processing systems using metal foil superpermeation

**How It Works**:
1. Convert hydrogen-containing mixtures into plasma
2. Press plasma against metal membranes
3. Hydrogen (including tritium) passes through, impurities blocked
4. Simultaneously compresses to pressure needed for fuel injection

**Value Proposition**:
- Reduces tritium inventory required for fusion plants (lower operational costs)
- Enables smaller, more economical facilities
- "Few orders of magnitude improvement" in throughput vs. existing experimental equipment

**Gold Transmutation Breakthrough** (Announced July 2025):
- Uses mercury-lithium alloy in breeding blanket
- Neutrons convert mercury-198 → mercury-197 → gold-197 (64hr decay)
- Production: 5,000 kg gold/year per 1 GW plant
- Value: $500M-$600M annually at current gold prices
- Economics: Doubles value of fusion plants (gold + electricity)
- Status: Simulation-validated, not experimentally proven

## Market & Traction

**The Tritium Problem**:
- Only ~20 kg tritium exists globally
- Commercial fusion plants need several kg just for startup
- Future fusion must breed own tritium (no alternative supply)
- Marathon solves this bottleneck

**Customer Validation**:
- ✅ **Commonwealth Fusion Systems**: Letter of Intent, $2B+ raised
- ✅ **Helion Energy**: Letter of Intent, $607M raised
- **Combined customer funding**: $2.6B+ validates fusion market momentum

**Market Timing**: Fusion commercialization 2030-2035 timeline, Marathon positions as critical infrastructure enabler

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Critical Fusion Infrastructure Bottleneck
**Evidence**: Only 20kg global tritium supply, fusion plants need kg-scale startup inventory
**Confidence**: High
**Implication**: Marathon addresses existential problem for fusion industry

### Finding 2: Tier-1 Customer Validation
**Evidence**: LOIs with Commonwealth ($2B raised) and Helion ($607M raised)
**Confidence**: High
**Implication**: Leading fusion companies validate Marathon's technology criticality

### Finding 3: Strong Technical Team
**Evidence**: 10 PhDs, ex-SpaceX/Helion/TAE/Princeton/Tesla experience
**Confidence**: High
**Implication**: Team has fusion industry depth to execute

### Finding 4: Gold Transmutation Could Double Plant Economics
**Evidence**: 5,000 kg gold/year = $500M+ revenue (simulation-based)
**Confidence**: Low-Medium (simulation only, not experimental)
**Implication**: If proven, transforms fusion economics from marginal to highly profitable

### Finding 5: Extremely Early Stage, Small Seed Round
**Evidence**: Founded 2023, only $5.9M seed (July 2024)
**Confidence**: High
**Implication**: Technology unproven at scale, will need $20M-$50M+ Series A

## Investment Assessment

**Risk Level**: **VERY HIGH**
- Pre-product, pre-revenue, technology unproven at scale
- Dependent on fusion industry commercialization (5-10+ year timeline)
- Small seed round insufficient for hardware scale-up

**Potential Return**: **VERY HIGH**
- If fusion commercializes, Marathon becomes critical infrastructure (every plant needs tritium systems)
- Gold transmutation (if proven) creates $500M+ revenue per plant
- Tier-1 customer validation (Commonwealth, Helion)

**Recommendation**: **HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD - MONITOR FOR SERIES A**
- Too early for mainstream investment (pre-product)
- Strong for venture portfolio (exceptional team, critical problem, customer validation)
- Watch for: Pilot system deployment, Series A fundraising, experimental gold transmutation validation
