## Reference Check Priorities

Based on narrative criticality and network connections, prioritize:

### Tier 1 (Critical)
1. **Founders Fund contact** - Verify Dirac introduction claim
2. **Tamarack Global partners** - Verify Figure sourcing relationship
3. **Fil Aronshtein (Dirac CEO)** - Verify value-add claims
4. **Faris Sbahi (Normal CEO)** - Verify advisory role and hiring referrals

### Tier 2 (High)
5. **Oskar Schulz (Cursor)** - Verify Harvard network claim
6. **Ilyas Khan (Quantinuum)** - Verify M&A/investor introductions
7. **Jamie Lee (Tamarack)** - Verify deal flow relationship

See [Reference Check List](/recommendations/reference-check-list/) for complete contact framework.

## Key Finding Summary

### Critical Findings (5)

1. **Henry Bellew zero involvement**: Co-GP with no documented portfolio engagement across 14 companies
2. **Figure concentration risk**: >50% of portfolio value in pre-revenue $39.5B company
3. **Harvard network gaps**: 0/3 claimed relationships with $30B valuation companies verified
4. **Natrion misrepresentation**: GM presented as customer but is actually investor
5. **Outdated performance data**: 12+ month gap in portfolio information

### Supporting Findings

- GP value-add 100% unverified (Tier 1 only)
- Funding discrepancies 40% error rate
- Thought leadership may be retroactively constructed
- Portfolio only 25% documented in detail

---

## Outcome Scenarios

### Best Case (9/10)
- All critical items verify
- Figure executes to valuation
- GP value-add confirmed
- Harvard network genuine
→ **Top-decile returns, strong fund**

### Base Case (7.5/10)
- Most critical items verify
- Figure partially delivers
- Some value-add confirmed
- Network adequate
→ **Strong returns with caveats**

### Downside Case (5.5/10)
- Multiple verification failures
- Figure compresses 50%+
- Value-add claims false
- Network overstated
→ **Below average, pass consideration**
