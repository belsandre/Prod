# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Figure AI Valuation Deep Dive

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Investment Decision)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

Figure AI represents **>50% of Hyperion's portfolio value** with a 94x paper MOIC ($40K → $3.76M) based on a **$39B valuation**. However, the company is **pre-revenue** with only pilot deployments (BMW, not yet production). This creates **extreme concentration risk** where portfolio returns are **binary**: top-decile IF Figure executes, OR significant compression if valuation unsustainable.

**Recommendation**: Conduct independent valuation analysis and execution risk assessment **before investment decision**. If Figure compresses 50%+, portfolio performance becomes mediocre despite Quantinuum success.

---

## Why This Is Critical

### 1. Extreme Portfolio Concentration

**The Math**:
- Dillon's $40K investment → $3.76M (94x) at $39B valuation
- Total portfolio: ~$1M deployed across 24 companies
- Figure represents: **>50% of total portfolio value**

**Implication**: Fund returns are almost entirely driven by single company
- If Figure delivers: Top-decile returns (9/10 rating)
- If Figure compresses 50%: Mediocre returns (5-6/10 rating)
- If Figure fails: Poor returns despite Quantinuum 6.7x

**Binary Outcome Structure**:
- **Probability of success**: Unknown but risky
- **Probability of average**: Low (either moon or bust)
- **Diversification**: Insufficient (24 companies but 1 drives value)

---

### 2. $39B on Minimal Revenue = Extreme Valuation Risk

**Figure AI Current Status** (as of Sept 2025):
- Valuation: **$39B**
- Revenue: **Minimal** (pre-revenue or very early revenue)
- Product: Figure 02 humanoid robot
- Deployment: **BMW pilot** (NOT yet production)
- Customers: 1-2 announced pilots
- Competition: Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics, others

**Valuation Comparables**:
- Tesla (entire company): ~$800B with $100B+ revenue
- Boston Dynamics (acquired by Hyundai): Undisclosed, but likely <$5B
- Most robotics companies: <$1B valuations

**$39B implies**: Figure is worth ~5% of Tesla based on... pilots?

**Red Flags**:
- Pre-revenue companies rarely sustain $39B valuations
- Valuation driven by 2024-2025 AI hype cycle (may compress)
- Comparable robotics companies worth <$1-5B
- No production deployments yet (pilots only)

---

### 3. Execution Risk: Can Figure Deliver?

**What Figure Needs to Achieve $39B Valuation**:

**Revenue Target** (assuming 10x P/S multiple):
- $39B valuation → Need ~$3.9B annual revenue
- Or $39B valuation → Need ~$1-2B revenue with 20-40x P/S (aggressive but possible for growth)

**Unit Economics** (estimated):
- Target robot cost: <$20K per unit (claimed goal, unproven)
- Need to sell: 50,000-100,000+ robots annually
- At scale production, deployment, maintenance required

**Current Status**:
- BMW pilot: Small-scale, not production
- Unit cost: Unknown (likely >>$20K at pilot scale)
- Production capacity: Unproven
- Customer pipeline: Limited visibility

**Execution Challenges**:
1. **Technical**: Achieve <$20K unit cost at scale (currently unknown)
2. **Manufacturing**: Scale production from pilots to 10,000s of units
3. **Sales**: Convert pilots to production deployments
4. **Competition**: Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics, others catching up
5. **Market**: Humanoid robotics market nascent, adoption uncertain

---

### 4. Competitive Threats

**Tesla Optimus**:
- Announced target: $20K per robot (same as Figure)
- Advantages: Tesla manufacturing scale, AI expertise, brand, capital
- Timeline: Production planned 2025-2026
- Risk to Figure: If Tesla delivers first at comparable cost, Figure's differentiation erodes

**Boston Dynamics (Hyundai)**:
- Leader in robotics for 30+ years
- Atlas humanoid demonstrated advanced capabilities
- Hyundai manufacturing and automotive integration
- Risk to Figure: Established robotics leader with deep expertise

**Others**:
- Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X Technologies, others entering market
- China: Multiple well-funded robotics companies

**Market Risk**: If 5-10 companies all produce $20K humanoid robots, commoditization drives margins to zero

---

## Valuation Analysis Framework

### Scenario 1: Bull Case ($39B Justified) ✅

**Assumptions**:
- Figure executes flawlessly
- Achieves <$20K unit cost at scale by 2027
- BMW pilot → production deployment 2026
- Expands to 5-10 Fortune 500 customers by 2028
- Sells 50,000+ robots annually by 2029
- Revenue: $1-2B by 2029 with high growth trajectory
- Market leader in humanoid robotics (beats Tesla Optimus)

**Valuation Logic**:
- $1-2B revenue * 20-40x P/S (high-growth SaaS multiples) = $20-80B
- $39B is mid-range, justified if execution on track

**Probability**: 20-30%
- Requires everything to go right
- Technical, manufacturing, market risks all resolved
- Competition doesn't catch up or surpass

**Portfolio Outcome**: Top-decile (9/10 rating)

---

### Scenario 2: Base Case ($15-20B Fair Value) ⚠️

**Assumptions**:
- Figure executes reasonably well but with delays
- Achieves ~$30K unit cost (above target) by 2028
- BMW pilot → limited production by 2027
- 2-3 Fortune 500 pilots by 2028
- Sells 10,000-20,000 robots annually by 2029
- Revenue: $300-600M by 2029
- Shares market with Tesla Optimus and Boston Dynamics

**Valuation Logic**:
- $300-600M revenue * 20-30x P/S = $6-18B
- Or comparable to Boston Dynamics ($3-5B) + premium for progress = $10-20B

**Current Valuation**: $39B → Fair value $15-20B
- **Compression**: 50-60%
- Dillon's position: $3.76M → $1.5-2M (still 38-50x MOIC, but 50% loss from current mark)

**Probability**: 40-50%
- Most likely scenario: Execution is messy, valuation compresses, but company survives

**Portfolio Outcome**: Strong (7/10 rating) - Figure still winner but compressed

---

### Scenario 3: Bear Case ($5-10B Fair Value) ❌

**Assumptions**:
- Figure faces significant execution challenges
- Unit cost remains high (>$40K) due to technical issues
- BMW pilot stalls or fails to convert to production
- Limited customer traction (1-2 pilots only)
- Sells <5,000 robots annually by 2029
- Revenue: <$200M by 2029
- Tesla Optimus or Boston Dynamics wins market

**Valuation Logic**:
- $100-200M revenue * 10-20x P/S = $1-4B
- Or comparable to failed robotics companies = $2-5B (down round or fire sale)

**Current Valuation**: $39B → Fair value $5-10B
- **Compression**: 75-87%
- Dillon's position: $3.76M → $500K-940K (still 13-24x MOIC, but 75%+ loss from current mark)

**Probability**: 20-30%
- Execution risk is real (robotics is hard)
- Market may not materialize as quickly as hoped
- Competition from Tesla/Boston Dynamics is serious

**Portfolio Outcome**: Below average (5-6/10 rating) - Even with Quantinuum, portfolio mediocre

---

### Scenario 4: Failure Case (<$5B, Down Round) ❌

**Assumptions**:
- Technical failure (can't achieve economics at scale)
- Market failure (humanoid robotics adoption slower than expected)
- Competition failure (Tesla Optimus wins, Figure loses)
- Company runs out of capital, down round or fire sale

**Valuation Logic**:
- $0-100M revenue, no path to profitability
- Valuation: $1-5B (down round) or acquihire/shutdown

**Current Valuation**: $39B → Fair value <$5B
- **Compression**: 87-100%
- Dillon's position: $3.76M → $0-500K (<13x MOIC)

**Probability**: 10-20%
- Unlikely total failure (too much talent/capital)
- But down round or fire sale possible

**Portfolio Outcome**: Poor (4-5/10 rating) - Portfolio fails despite Quantinuum

---

## Expected Value Calculation

**Weighted EV**:
- Bull (30%): $39B * 30% = $11.7B
- Base (45%): $17.5B * 45% = $7.9B
- Bear (20%): $7.5B * 20% = $1.5B
- Failure (5%): $2.5B * 5% = $0.1B

**Expected Valuation**: ~$21B (46% below current $39B)
**Expected Position Value**: $2.1M (44% below current $3.76M)
**Expected MOIC**: 53x (still strong, but 44% compression from current 94x)

**Implication**: Even in expected value terms, Figure is likely overvalued by ~50%

## Decision Framework

### If Fair Value = $30-40B (Close to Current)
**Assessment**: ✅ Valuation reasonable, execution risk acceptable

**Recommendation**: Proceed with investment
- Figure valuation is defensible based on progress and market potential
- Concentration risk acceptable given strong fundamentals
- Monitor quarterly for progress updates

---

### If Fair Value = $20-30B (Modest Compression)
**Assessment**: ⚠️ Valuation high but defensible, some compression likely

**Recommendation**: Proceed with caution
- Figure likely overvalued by 25-40%
- Portfolio returns still strong in base case (53x MOIC)
- Negotiate for larger commitment to diversify concentration
- Or accept concentration risk with eyes open

---

### If Fair Value = $10-20B (Major Compression)
**Assessment**: ⚠️ Valuation significantly high, major compression likely

**Recommendation**: Proceed only with discounted terms OR pass
- Figure likely overvalued by 50-75%
- Portfolio returns become mediocre in base case
- Request: Discount on Hyperion fund valuation to reflect Figure risk
- Or: Pass and wait for Figure valuation to stabilize

---

### If Fair Value = <$10B (Extreme Overvaluation)
**Assessment**: ❌ Valuation unsustainable, major risk to portfolio

**Recommendation**: **PASS** on investment
- Figure overvalued by 75%+
- Portfolio returns collapse in base case
- Concentration risk too high with unstable valuation
- Wait for down round or valuation correction before investing

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Proceeding Despite Concerns

**Strategy 1: Negotiate Portfolio Diversification**
- Request Dillon deploy more capital to other winners (Quantinuum, Normal, Dirac)
- Reduce Figure concentration from >50% to <40% of value

**Strategy 2: Discount Fund Valuation**
- If Figure fair value is $20B (not $39B), discount Hyperion fund value accordingly
- Apply haircut to TVPI calculation

**Strategy 3: Secondary Sale Rights**
- Negotiate ability to sell Figure position if secondary market emerges
- Or: Pro-rata rights to participate in future Figure rounds (if down round, can re-calibrate)

**Strategy 4: Quarterly Monitoring**
- Require quarterly updates on Figure progress (BMW pilot → production, new customer pilots, unit cost trajectory)
- Build in exit clauses if Figure stalls
