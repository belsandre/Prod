# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Verify Harvard Network Quality

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Investment Decision)
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

Dillon claims "close relationships" with founders/operators at several high-value Harvard-connected companies (Cursor $9.9B, Mercor $10B, Cognition/Devin $10B), yet **0 out of 3 are LinkedIn connections**. Of 6 specific Harvard relationships claimed in dataroom materials, only **2 out of 6 (33%) can be verified** through LinkedIn.

**Recommendation**: Independently verify the quality and depth of Dillon's Harvard network through direct outreach to claimed contacts and portfolio founder references. This is a critical validation of the "youngest Harvard-led GP with most privileged access" positioning.

---

## Why This Is Critical

### 1. Core Positioning Relies on Harvard Network

**Dataroom Claims**:
- "Youngest Harvard-led GP in all of venture"
- "Most privileged access to upstart Harvard founders"
- Relationships with founders at Cursor, Mercor, Cognition/Devin

**If Harvard network is overstated**:
- Core fund differentiation collapses
- "Privileged access" claim is marketing, not reality
- Deal flow pipeline may be weaker than presented

---

### 2. Zero Verification of $30B Combined Valuation Companies

**High-Value Claims (0/3 Verified)**:

| Company | Valuation | Claimed Relationship | LinkedIn Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Cursor/Anysphere** | $9.9B | "Friendship with President Oskar Schulz '23" | **NOT CONNECTED** |
| **Mercor** | $10B | "Friendship with 1st hire & angel investor Virat Talwar '23" | **NOT CONNECTED** |
| **Cognition/Devin** | $10B | "Classmate of CEO Scott Wu '19" | **NOT CONNECTED** |

**Critical Issue**: The most valuable relationships claimed are the least verifiable.

**Additional Concern**: For Cursor and Mercor, claimed relationships are with non-founders:
- Cursor: "President" (not founder)
- Mercor: "1st hire & angel investor" (not founder)

---

### 3. Only 2 of 6 Claimed Relationships Verified

**Verification Results**:

| Person | Company | Status | LinkedIn |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Oskar Schulz | Cursor | **NOT FOUND** | No connection |
| Virat Talwar | Mercor | **NOT FOUND** | No connection |
| Scott Wu | Cognition | **NOT FOUND** | No connection |
| Kushan Weerakoon | ProDex Labs | **VERIFIED** | Connected |
| Justin Mack | Garden | **VERIFIED** | Connected |
| Henry Zhou | Stealth | **NOT FOUND** | No connection |

**Summary**: 33% verification rate on claimed Harvard relationships

---

### 4. PROD Accelerator Network Missing

**Claim**: Privileged access to PROD accelerator ecosystem (Harvard startup program)

**Finding**: Zero connections found to anyone listing "PROD" in their profile

**Implication**: Key sourcing advantage claim cannot be verified

## Questions for GP

### Direct Questions for Dillon

**Q1**: "You claim friendship with Oskar Schulz at Cursor. When did you last communicate with him? Would he take a reference call from us?"

**Purpose**: Test if relationship is current and meaningful

**Good Answer**: Specific recent interaction, willingness to provide reference

**Concerning Answer**: Vague, defers, or admits relationship is distant

---

**Q2**: "You mention being a classmate of Scott Wu at Cognition. What was your relationship like at Harvard? Have you stayed in touch?"

**Purpose**: Verify classmate claim and relationship quality

**Good Answer**: Specific stories from Harvard, recent communication

**Concerning Answer**: Can't provide specifics, admits limited contact

---

**Q3**: "How have these Harvard relationships translated to deal flow? Have Cursor, Mercor, or Cognition referred deals to you?"

**Purpose**: Test practical value of claimed relationships

**Good Answer**: Specific deals sourced through these relationships

**Concerning Answer**: No concrete deals, only "potential future" value

---

**Q4**: "Why are Oskar Schulz, Virat Talwar, and Scott Wu not LinkedIn connections despite being claimed as friends/classmates?"

**Purpose**: Address gap directly

**Acceptable Answers**:
- "They don't use LinkedIn" (verify this is true)
- "I know them through other channels" (verify those channels)
- "Connection request pending" (verify timing)

**Concerning Answers**:
- Defensive or evasive
- Claims relationships don't need LinkedIn (but other relationships do?)

---

## Verification Steps

### Tier 1: Direct Outreach to Claimed Contacts

1. **Oskar Schulz (Cursor)**
   - Reach through Cursor investor network
   - Ask: "Do you know Dillon Dunteman? Would you describe him as a friend?"

2. **Virat Talwar (Mercor)**
   - Reach through Mercor investor network
   - Ask: "How do you know Dillon? Has he invested in or referred deals to Mercor?"

3. **Scott Wu (Cognition)**
   - Reach through Harvard alumni network or Cognition investors
   - Ask: "Were you classmates with Dillon? Do you stay in touch?"

### Tier 2: Portfolio Founder References

During founder reference calls, ask:

- "Has Dillon introduced you to other Harvard founders?"
- "How would you describe Dillon's Harvard network?"
- "Have you seen Dillon leverage Harvard relationships for your company?"

### Tier 3: Harvard Network Spot-Checks

- Contact 2-3 verified Harvard connections (e.g., Justin Mack, Kushan Weerakoon)
- Ask about relationship quality with Dillon
- Ask if they've seen evidence of Dillon's broader Harvard network

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Cannot provide references**: Claimed contacts refuse or are unreachable
- **One-sided relationship**: Dillon knows them, but they don't recognize him
- **No practical value**: Relationships exist but haven't generated deals
- **Recency issues**: Relationships are from Harvard (2015-2019) but not maintained
- **Indirect knowledge**: "I know someone who knows them" vs direct relationship

---

## Evaluation Framework

### Scenario 1: Relationships Verified and Active

**Evidence Required**:
- 2+ of 3 high-value contacts confirm meaningful relationship
- Specific deals sourced through Harvard network
- Recent communication (last 6-12 months)

**Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE - Harvard positioning validated

**Action**: Proceed with confidence in deal flow pipeline

---

### Scenario 2: Relationships Exist but Distant

**Evidence**:
- Contacts confirm knowing Dillon but limited recent contact
- No deals sourced through these relationships
- "Acquaintance" vs "friendship"

**Assessment**: CONCERNING - Harvard network overstated

**Action**:
- Discount "privileged access" claim in evaluation
- Assess deal flow based on verified sources only
- Adjust fund thesis confidence

---

### Scenario 3: Relationships Cannot Be Verified

**Evidence**:
- Contacts don't recognize Dillon
- Cannot reach claimed contacts
- Evidence of one-sided claims

**Assessment**: UNACCEPTABLE - Material misrepresentation

**Action**: **PASS ON INVESTMENT**

**Rationale**: If core fund positioning (Harvard network) is fabricated, cannot trust other dataroom representations.
