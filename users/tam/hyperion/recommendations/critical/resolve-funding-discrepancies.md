# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Resolve Funding Discrepancies

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Investment Decision)
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

Dataroom contains **material discrepancies** for 2 of 5 tier-1 portfolio companies (Dirac, Normal Computing). Funding amounts in dataroom do not match public announcements, with gaps ranging from 78% to potentially 2x.

**Implication**: If dataroom contains false or misleading information for core portfolio holdings, **all dataroom representations are suspect** (valuations, check sizes, performance metrics, value-add claims).

**Recommendation**: Require written explanation from GPs **immediately**. If unresolved, this is a **major red flag** that should trigger pass decision.

## The Discrepancies

### 1. Dirac - $4.7M Gap (78% Larger Than Claimed)

**Dataroom Claim**:
- Round: Seed (April 2024)
- Amount: **$6M**
- Investors: Coatue & Founders Fund (co-leads)
- Source: Case Studies - Outperforming Investments.md

**Public Announcement**:
- Round: Seed (April 2024)
- Amount: **$10.7M**
- Investors: Coatue & Founders Fund (co-leads)
- Source: Public PR / funding announcement

**Gap**: **$4.7M (78% larger than claimed)**

**Why This Matters**:
- Dirac is tier-1 company with exceptional co-investors (FF, Coatue)
- Used as case study for Dillon's value-add (claimed FF introduction)
- If dataroom underreports by 78%, what else is misreported?

---

### 2. Normal Computing - $18M Gap OR Round Mismatch

**Dataroom Claim**:
- Round: **Series A** (April 2024)
- Amount: **$17M**
- Lead: Drive Capital
- Source: Case Studies - Outperforming Investments.md

**Public Sources**:
- Round: **Total seed capital**
- Amount: **$35M**
- Source: Company research, public announcements

**Gap**: **$18M OR round designation mismatch**

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Dataroom mislabeled "Series A" when it's actually seed extension
2. $35M is cumulative seed, $17M is Series A (but then why labeled differently?)
3. Public sources are wrong (unlikely - multiple sources)
4. Dataroom intentionally underreports (major red flag)

**Why This Matters**:
- Normal Computing is tier-1 company preparing Series B
- Used as case study for Dillon's value-add (advisory role, hiring referrals)
- Dillon claimed ~$80K equity award (double his $40K investment)
- If funding amount/stage is wrong, how accurate are other claims?

## Pattern Analysis

### Only 2 of 5 Tier-1 Companies Have Discrepancies... But 2 of 5 is 40%

**Tier-1 Portfolio** (5 companies):
1. **Figure AI**: Dataroom matches public ($39B valuation verified)
2. **Quantinuum**: Dataroom matches public ($10.6B valuation verified)
3. **Zap Energy**: No public verification (dataroom claims ~$1.1B valuation) - ❓ UNVERIFIED
4. **Dirac**: ❌ DISCREPANCY ($6M vs $10.7M)
5. **Normal Computing**: ❌ DISCREPANCY ($17M vs $35M OR round mismatch)

**Verification Rate**: 2 verified, 2 discrepancies, 1 unverified = **40% error rate** for checkable facts

**Implication**: If 40% of verifiable claims have errors, how many unverifiable claims (value-add, sourcing, referrals) are also false?

---

### Discrepancies All Favor GP Narrative

**Both discrepancies underreport funding**:
- Dirac: Underreported by $4.7M (makes Dillon's $20K check seem more significant?)
- Normal: Underreported or mislabeled stage (makes Series A prep seem more impressive?)

**Pattern**: Discrepancies systematically favor GP's narrative of "early investor" and "small check, big impact."

**Alternative Explanation**: Honest mistakes due to timing (dataroom created before final numbers public). **But then why not update?**

---

## Questions for GPs

### Dirac Discrepancy

1. **Why does dataroom show $6M seed but public announcement shows $10.7M seed?**
   - Is this a timing issue (dataroom created before final close)?
   - Is this a mistake in dataroom materials?
   - Or is there a different explanation?

2. **What was the actual final round size?**
   - Please provide: Round type, close date, final amount, lead investors
   - Please provide: Documentation (term sheet, press release, investor list)

3. **If $10.7M is correct, why wasn't dataroom updated?**
   - When was dataroom last updated?
   - How often are portfolio company details refreshed?
   - What quality control process exists for dataroom accuracy?

---

### Normal Computing Discrepancy

1. **Why does dataroom show "$17M Series A (April 2024)" but public sources show "$35M total seed"?**
   - Is "$17M Series A" a separate round from "$35M seed"?
   - Or is this a round labeling error (Series A vs seed extension)?
   - What is the correct chronology of Normal's funding rounds?

2. **What is Normal Computing's actual funding history?**
   - Please provide: All rounds (seed, extensions, Series A if applicable)
   - Please provide: Dates, amounts, investors for each round
   - Please provide: Documentation (announcements, investor confirmations)

3. **How does this affect Dillon's claimed advisory role timeline?**
   - Dataroom claims Dillon helped with "Series A raise" in 1H 2024
   - If round is actually seed extension (not Series A), does this change narrative?
   - When exactly did CEO offer advisory role relative to funding events?

---

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Request Written Explanation (Week 1)

**Action**: Send formal request to GPs for written explanation of both discrepancies

**Template Email**:
```
Dear Dillon and Henry,

During our due diligence process, we identified discrepancies between dataroom materials
and public funding announcements for two portfolio companies:

1. Dirac: Dataroom shows $6M seed (April 2024), but public PR shows $10.7M seed (April 2024)
2. Normal Computing: Dataroom shows $17M Series A (April 2024), but public sources show
   $35M total seed capital

Could you please provide:
1. Written explanation for each discrepancy
2. Documentation of actual funding amounts (term sheets, press releases, investor confirmations)
3. Clarification on when dataroom was last updated and quality control process

We need to resolve these discrepancies before proceeding with investment decision.

Best regards,
[Investment Team]
```

**Timeline**: Request response within 3 business days

### Step 2: Evaluate Response Quality

**Green Flags** (Acceptable Explanations):
- ✅ Honest mistake, dataroom created before final close, here's updated data
- ✅ Round labeling error (Series A vs seed extension), here's corrected chronology
- ✅ Public sources are wrong, here's documentation proving dataroom is correct
- ✅ Proactive offer to update entire dataroom with quality control process

**Yellow Flags** (Concerning Responses):
- ⚠️ Defensive response without documentation
- ⚠️ Blames research team for "misreading" dataroom
- ⚠️ Provides partial explanation without full documentation
- ⚠️ Can't explain why dataroom wasn't updated if info was public

**Red Flags** (Unacceptable Responses):
- ❌ Refuses to provide documentation
- ❌ Claims discrepancies don't matter ("immaterial")
- ❌ Contradicts public information without proof
- ❌ Provides explanation that creates new inconsistencies
- ❌ No response or slow response (>5 business days)

---

### Step 3: Independent Verification

**If GP explanation is unclear or defensive**, independently verify:

**Dirac Verification**:
- [ ] Contact Coatue or Founders Fund (co-leads) to confirm round size
- [ ] Search SEC filings (if applicable)
- [ ] Contact Dirac CEO directly (if LP access allows)
- [ ] Review TechCrunch, Bloomberg, WSJ for funding announcements

**Normal Verification**:
- [ ] Contact Drive Capital (claimed Series A lead) to confirm round details
- [ ] Review Crunchbase, PitchBook funding history
- [ ] Contact Normal CEO directly (if LP access allows)
- [ ] Cross-reference with company website announcements

---

## Decision Framework

### Scenario 1: Honest Mistake, Quickly Resolved
**GP Response**: "Apologies, dataroom was created before final close. Here's updated data with documentation."

**Actions**:
- [ ] Verify documentation provided
- [ ] Request updated dataroom for all portfolio companies
- [ ] Establish quality control requirement for future updates
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed (concern resolved)

---

### Scenario 2: Plausible Explanation, Documentation Provided
**GP Response**: "Round labeling error - here's corrected chronology with documentation."

**Actions**:
- [ ] Verify explanation matches independent sources
- [ ] Assess whether explanation changes narrative (e.g., "helped with Series A" vs "helped with seed extension")
- [ ] Request dataroom corrections
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed with caution (verify all other dataroom claims more carefully)

---

### Scenario 3: Defensive or Inadequate Response
**GP Response**: Defensive, no documentation, or claims discrepancies don't matter

**Actions**:
- [ ] Escalate to investment committee
- [ ] Conduct independent verification via co-investors
- [ ] Reassess all dataroom claims as potentially unreliable
- [ ] **Decision**: Consider pass (credibility compromised)

---

### Scenario 4: No Response or Evasive
**GP Response**: No response >5 days, or evasive non-answer

**Actions**:
- [ ] Immediate escalation to investment committee
- [ ] **Decision**: Strong recommendation to PASS (red flag for integrity)

---

## Broader Implications

### If Discrepancies Are Honest Mistakes
**Impact**: Moderate concern
- Suggests sloppy dataroom preparation
- Requires more rigorous verification of all claims
- Not disqualifying, but reduces confidence

**Mitigations**:
- Require updated, audited dataroom
- Independent verification of all material facts
- Increase scrutiny on unverifiable claims (value-add, sourcing)

---

### If Discrepancies Are Intentional
**Impact**: CRITICAL red flag
- Suggests intentional misrepresentation for fundraising
- ALL dataroom claims become suspect
- Major integrity concern

**Recommendation**: **PASS ON INVESTMENT**

**Rationale**: If GPs willing to misrepresent basic facts (funding amounts), they will misrepresent complex claims (value-add, performance, sourcing). This is disqualifying.

---

## Related Concerns

### This Compounds Other Credibility Issues

**Already Identified**:
1. ❌ Dirac customer claims (Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed) - NO public verification
2. ❌ Natrion GM customer claim - FALSE/MISLEADING (per research)
3. ❌ Emerge Apple/Meta acquisition interest - UNVERIFIED
4. ❓ Zap Energy $1.1B valuation - NO public verification
5. ❓ ALL value-add claims - ZERO independent verification

**Pattern**: Multiple instances where dataroom claims cannot be verified or are contradicted by research.

**Cumulative Effect**: If 40% of checkable claims have errors, and multiple uncheckable claims are suspicious, **dataroom is unreliable as due diligence source**.
