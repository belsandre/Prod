# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Request Updated Fund Performance Data

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Investment Decision Basis)
**Timeline**: Immediate (1 week)
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

The fund performance data in the dataroom is dated October 2025 but appears to contain information that is actually from 2024. This creates a **12+ month data gap** for a fund evaluation. Given market volatility in AI/deeptech valuations, current portfolio marks may differ significantly.

**Recommendation**: Request updated portfolio performance data as of November 2025 with current valuations, recent funding rounds, and any material changes since the dataroom was prepared.

---

## Why This Is Critical

### 1. 12+ Month Data Gap Is Material

**Dataroom Header**: October 2025
**Actual Data**: Appears to be from 2024 or earlier

**Why This Matters**:
- AI/deeptech valuations have shifted significantly
- Some portfolio companies may have raised new rounds
- Some companies may have changed status (down rounds, shut downs, exits)
- Performance metrics (TVPI, IRR) may be outdated

---

### 2. Figure AI Valuation May Have Changed

**Figure AI represents >50% of portfolio value**

**Last Known Valuation**: $39B (Series C, September 2025)

**Questions**:
- Has there been any secondary activity since September?
- Any operational updates (revenue, deployments) affecting valuation?
- Any competitive developments (Tesla Optimus) impacting outlook?

**Impact**: Even 10% change in Figure valuation = 5%+ change in fund TVPI

---

### 3. Quantinuum May Have New Data

**Last Known**: $10.6B valuation (March 2025 secondary)

**Questions**:
- Any new funding rounds?
- Helios launch (November 2025) - any valuation impact?
- Current public market comparables?

---

### 4. Other Portfolio Companies

**Potential Changes**:
- New funding rounds (markups or down rounds)
- Company shutdowns or distress
- Customer wins or losses
- Team changes

**Unknown**: Status of 10+ companies not detailed in dataroom

---

## Information Requested

### 1. Updated Portfolio Summary
- All 24 companies with current valuations
- Most recent funding round for each
- Any material changes since October 2024

### 2. Performance Metrics (as of November 2025)
- Net TVPI
- Net IRR
- DPI (any distributions?)

### 3. Company-Level Detail
For each company:
- Current valuation and basis
- Most recent third-party valuation event
- Any down rounds or markdowns
- Any shutdowns or writeoffs

### 4. Notable Events
- Companies that raised since last update
- Companies with material customer wins/losses
- Team changes at portfolio companies
- Any exits or liquidity events

---

## Why Timely Data Matters

### Investment Decision

- **Cannot evaluate fund on 12-month-old data**: Market conditions have changed
- **Cannot compare to benchmarks**: Need current vintage comparison
- **Cannot assess concentration risk**: Figure valuation may have shifted

### Specific Concerns

| Item | Risk if Data Outdated |
|------|----------------------|
| Figure AI 94x | Could be higher or lower post-Helios, competition |
| Quantinuum 6.7x | New rounds, Helios launch may change value |
| Failed companies | Unknown if more shutdowns occurred |
| New investments | Fund may have made additional investments |
| Fund TVPI 6.7x | May be materially different today |

Dear Dillon,

As we continue our due diligence on Hyperion Ventures I LP, we noticed the portfolio performance data in the dataroom appears to be from 2024 despite the October 2025 date.

To complete our evaluation, we require updated information as of November 2025:

1. **Complete portfolio list**: All 24 companies with current valuations and basis
