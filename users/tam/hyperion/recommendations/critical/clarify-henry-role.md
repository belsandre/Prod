# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Clarify Henry Bellew's Role

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Investment Decision)
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

Co-GP Henry Bellew has **ZERO documented involvement** across all 14 researched portfolio companies, including 5 companies with exceptional MOICs (Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x). For a General Partner to show complete absence from portfolio work is **highly unusual** and raises fundamental questions about team dynamics, value contribution, and GP economics justification.

**Recommendation**: Interview both GPs **immediately** to understand division of labor, Henry's actual role, and value contribution. This is a **structural concern** about fund operations and team capability.

---

## Why This Is Critical

### 1. Zero Portfolio Involvement = Major Red Flag

**Research Findings**:
- **Tier 1 Companies**: 0/5 (0%) - No involvement in Figure, Quantinuum, Dirac, Normal, Zap
- **Tier 2 Companies**: 0/9 (0%) - No involvement in any secondary company
- **Total**: 0/14 companies (0%)
- **Dataroom Mentions**: ZERO - No case studies, no testimonials, no quotes
- **External Mentions**: ZERO - No press, no LinkedIn, no founder acknowledgments

**What This Means**:
- For comparison, Dillon has 9/14 (64%) involvement
- Henry absent from ALL winners (Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x, Normal, Dirac)
- No evidence of contribution to fund's success

---

### 2. GP Economics May Not Be Justified

**Standard GP Structure**: Both GPs typically receive:
- Management fees (2% of AUM)
- Carried interest (20% of profits)
- Equal or defined split per partnership agreement

**If Henry contributes zero portfolio value**:
- How is his GP economics justified?
- Are LPs paying for a GP who doesn't engage with investments?
- Does this create misalignment between contribution and compensation?

**Typical VC Fund Expectations**:
- Both GPs engage with portfolio companies
- Clear division of labor (e.g., sourcing vs operations, sector specialization)
- Team redundancy for coverage and support

**Hyperion Reality**: Single GP (Dillon) carrying all portfolio work

---

### 3. Single Point of Failure Risk

**If Only Dillon Engages with Portfolio**:
- What happens if Dillon is unavailable (illness, departure, conflict)?
- Who provides portfolio company support?
- How do founders access GP resources?
- What's the succession plan?

**Team Redundancy Missing**:
- No backup GP for founder relationships
- No alternative strategic advisor if Dillon unavailable
- Fund operations dependent on one person

---

### 4. Raises Questions About Fund Story

**Dataroom Positioning**: "Hyperion Ventures I LP" (plural GPs, team fund)

**Reality**: Appears to be Dillon's solo fund with Henry as... what?

**Questions**:
- Is Henry a true operating GP or passive partner?
- Was Henry brought on for credentials/network but not operations?
- Is this a transition arrangement (Henry growing into role)?
- Or is Henry's absence intentional (backstage role)?

---

## Questions for GPs

### Interview Structure

**Format**: Joint interview with both Dillon and Henry present (observe team dynamic)

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Tone**: Professional, non-accusatory, seeking clarity

---

### Questions for Dillon

**Q1**: "Dillon, can you walk us through your typical week working with portfolio companies? How much time do you spend on portfolio support vs new deal sourcing?"

**Purpose**: Establish baseline of Dillon's portfolio engagement

**Good Answer**: "I spend ~60% on portfolio, ~40% on sourcing. Weekly check-ins with 5-6 core companies, monthly with rest."

**Concerning Answer**: "I spend nearly all my time on portfolio - it's a lot of work."
→ Implication: If Dillon doing everything, where's Henry?

---

**Q2**: "How do you and Henry divide responsibilities? What's his primary focus?"

**Purpose**: Understand division of labor

**Good Answer**: "Henry focuses on [specific activities]: operations/LP relations/fundraising/sector X. I focus on [complementary activities]."

**Concerning Answer**: "Henry is more backstage" OR "We haven't formalized division yet"
→ Implication: No clear role definition = Henry not contributing proportionally

---

**Q3**: "Can you share an example of a recent portfolio company challenge where you and Henry worked together to solve it?"

**Purpose**: Test whether they actually collaborate

**Good Answer**: Specific example with Henry's contribution described

**Concerning Answer**: Can't provide example OR "Henry wasn't involved in that"
→ Implication: They don't actually work together on portfolio

---

### Questions for Henry

**Q4**: "Henry, how would you describe your role at Hyperion? What are you responsible for?"

**Purpose**: Hear Henry's own description of his role

**Good Answer**: Clear, specific responsibilities with examples

**Concerning Answer**: Vague ("support Dillon", "strategic advisor") without specifics
→ Implication: Role is undefined or ceremonial

---

**Q5**: "Which portfolio companies are you most actively engaged with? What does that engagement look like?"

**Purpose**: Test portfolio involvement directly

**Good Answer**: Names 2-3 companies with specific activities (board observer, recruiting, strategic projects)

**Concerning Answer**: Can't name companies OR "I'm not directly involved with portfolio"
→ Implication: Zero portfolio engagement confirmed

---

**Q6**: "Can you share an example of how you've helped a portfolio company in the last 3 months?"

**Purpose**: Test recent contribution

**Good Answer**: Specific, detailed example from recent work

**Concerning Answer**: Can't provide example OR refers to non-portfolio work
→ Implication: Not actively contributing to portfolio value

---

**Q7**: "What's your typical week look like? How do you spend your time?"

**Purpose**: Understand where Henry's time goes

**Good Answer**: Portfolio work, LP relations, operations, fundraising (fund-related activities)

**Concerning Answer**: Raine Group work, other commitments, unclear
→ Implication: Hyperion is part-time or secondary priority

---

### Questions for Both

**Q8**: "How do you see your partnership evolving over the next 1-2 years? Will Henry's role change?"

**Purpose**: Understand if this is temporary or permanent structure

**Good Answer**: "Henry is transitioning to more portfolio work as fund scales" (growth plan)

**Concerning Answer**: "This is how we operate" (no plan to change)
→ Implication: Henry's absence is permanent, not transitional

---

**Q9**: "If a portfolio company CEO needs urgent help (hiring, fundraising, strategic decision), who do they call? What if that person is unavailable?"

**Purpose**: Test redundancy and backup systems

**Good Answer**: "Both of us, depending on need. We have clear backup protocols."

**Concerning Answer**: "They call Dillon. No formal backup."
→ Implication: Single point of failure confirmed

---

**Q10**: "How do you justify GP economics split given the division of labor?"

**Purpose**: Direct question about compensation alignment

**Good Answer**: "Henry contributes [X, Y, Z] which justifies his economics. We've aligned compensation with contribution."

**Concerning Answer**: Defensive, vague, or refuses to discuss
→ Implication: Misalignment between contribution and compensation

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Interview Red Flags

❌ **Henry can't describe specific portfolio contributions**
→ Suggests role is ceremonial, not operational

❌ **Dillon does all the talking, Henry defers**
→ Suggests unequal partnership, Dillon is real decision-maker

❌ **Vague answers about division of labor**
→ Suggests no clear structure, roles undefined

❌ **No examples of recent collaboration**
→ Suggests they don't actually work together

❌ **Henry refers to "other commitments" (Raine Group, etc.)**
→ Suggests Hyperion is part-time, not primary focus

❌ **Defensive responses to questions**
→ Suggests they're aware this is a problem but haven't addressed it

---

### Follow-Up Red Flags

After interview, check:

❌ **Henry's LinkedIn shows Raine Group as current primary role**
→ Hyperion is secondary commitment

❌ **Henry's LinkedIn has no Hyperion-related posts**
→ Not publicly identifying with fund

❌ **Portfolio founders don't know Henry**
→ Confirm via reference calls: "Have you worked with Henry Bellew?"

---

## Evaluation Framework

### Scenario 1: Defined Division of Labor ✅

**GP Responses**:
- Henry has clear non-portfolio role (LP relations, operations, fundraising)
- Dillon handles portfolio, Henry handles firm operations
- Both contribute meaningfully to fund success
- Team has redundancy protocols

**Evidence Required**:
- Henry can describe specific contributions (LP relationships, operational systems, processes built)
- Dillon confirms Henry's contributions are valuable
- Division of labor makes sense given backgrounds (Dillon: technical/investing, Henry: operations/fundraising)

**Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE
- Non-traditional structure but defensible
- Both GPs contributing, just in different areas
- Henry's absence from portfolio is intentional design, not neglect

**Recommendation**: Proceed, but request:
- Documentation of Henry's contributions (LP relationships, operational systems)
- Clarity on succession planning if Dillon unavailable
- Understanding of how Henry's role will scale with fund growth

---

### Scenario 2: Henry Is Growing Into Role ⚠️

**GP Responses**:
- Henry is 2 years post-grad, learning the business
- Plan for Henry to take on more portfolio work as he gains experience
- Dillon is mentor, Henry is apprentice (for now)

**Evidence Required**:
- Specific timeline for Henry's role expansion
- Examples of Henry's learning/development activities
- Plan for how Henry will contribute to Fund II

**Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE WITH CAVEATS
- Reasonable if Henry is junior partner learning
- But raises questions: Why call him "GP" if he's apprentice?
- Should be reflected in economics (junior carry, not equal GP split?)

**Recommendation**: Proceed if:
- Clear development plan for Henry with milestones
- Economics reflect experience gap (not equal split if contributions unequal)
- Dillon commits to mentoring and Henry commits to ramping up

---

### Scenario 3: Henry Is Credential Partner ⚠️

**GP Responses**:
- Henry brought on for Harvard network, Raine relationships
- Not expected to do day-to-day portfolio work
- Provides strategic advice and network access as needed

**Evidence Required**:
- Examples of Henry's network contributions (LP introductions, deal flow, portfolio connections)
- Founder testimonials that Henry's network has been valuable
- Clear understanding this is his role (not operational GP)

**Assessment**: CONCERNING BUT POSSIBLY ACCEPTABLE
- "Credential partner" model exists in VC but should be explicit
- Economics should reflect this (lower carry % than Dillon)
- Question: Is Henry's network actually valuable? (Zero usage documented so far)

**Recommendation**: Proceed only if:
- Henry's network has demonstrable value (examples of LP intros, deal flow, portfolio helps)
- Economics reflect non-operational role
- Fund strategy explicitly positions Henry as network/strategic resource, not operating GP
- LPs understand and accept this structure

---

### Scenario 4: Henry Has No Meaningful Role ❌

**GP Responses**:
- Vague, defensive, can't articulate Henry's contribution
- No clear division of labor
- No examples of Henry's value-add
- "Henry is figuring out his role" or "We're still defining it"

**Evidence**:
- Henry can't describe contributions beyond "supporting Dillon"
- No specific examples of work done
- Other commitments (Raine) take priority over Hyperion
- No plan for Henry to ramp up

**Assessment**: UNACCEPTABLE - RED FLAG
- Henry is effectively a non-contributing partner
- GP economics not justified by contribution
- Single point of failure (Dillon only)
- Misrepresentation to LPs (fund presented as team, reality is solo)

**Recommendation**: **PASS ON INVESTMENT**

**Rationale**: If GPs can't justify one partner's role and contribution, this is a fundamental structural problem. Either:
1. Henry should not be GP (should be advisor, not partner)
2. Or economics should be adjusted to reflect contribution (Dillon gets majority of carry)
3. Or fund should be repositioned as Dillon's solo fund with Henry as junior/learning partner

Without clarity, this is a governance and alignment issue that will cause problems.

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Henry's Role | Evidence Required | Outcome | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| 1. Defined Division | Operations, LP relations, non-portfolio | Specific contributions documented | ✅ ACCEPTABLE | Proceed with documentation |
| 2. Growing Into Role | Learning, developing, plans to ramp | Development plan + timeline | ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE | Proceed with milestones |
| 3. Credential Partner | Network, strategic advice | Network value demonstrated | ⚠️ CONCERNING | Proceed only if economics adjusted |
| 4. No Meaningful Role | Undefined, vague, no contributions | None - can't articulate role | ❌ UNACCEPTABLE | **PASS** |

## If They Refuse to Clarify

**Possible GP Response**: "This is our internal team structure. We don't need to justify it."

**Investment Team Response**:

"We respect your autonomy on team structure. However, as potential LPs, we need to understand:
1. How the team operates
2. Whether both GPs contribute proportionally to their economics
3. Whether the fund has redundancy if one GP is unavailable

Our research shows zero documented involvement from Henry across 14 portfolio companies. This raises questions about team capability, alignment, and structure.

If you can't provide clarity on Henry's role and contribution, we cannot proceed with investment. This is a standard due diligence requirement for multi-GP funds."

**If still refused**: This is a **major red flag**. Recommend **PASS**.
