# CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Verify GP Value-Add Claims

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Investment Decision)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

100% of Dillon Dunteman's value-add evidence comes from GP-controlled dataroom sources with **ZERO independent verification**. This is the **single most important due diligence item** - if GP value-add claims are false or exaggerated, the fund's differentiation thesis collapses.

**Recommendation**: Conduct independent verification through founder reference calls and VC partner confirmations **before proceeding** with investment.

---

## Why This Is Critical

### The Core Thesis Depends On It

Hyperion's differentiation narrative is built on Dillon's ability to:
1. Source proprietary deal flow through relationships
2. Provide exceptional value-add to portfolio founders
3. Leverage deep network for VC introductions and hiring

**If unverified**: Portfolio becomes "opportunistic timing in bull market with access to quality deals" (still valuable, but less differentiated and possibly luck-based).

**If verified**: Strong signal of repeatable sourcing and value-creation capabilities.

### Pattern of Unverified Claims

**ALL value-add activities are Tier 1 (dataroom) only**:
- Dirac: "Introduced CEO to friend at Founders Fund"
- Normal: "Referred 2 key hires", "$80K advisory equity award"
- Figure: "Sourced via close Tamarack relationship"
- Quantinuum: "Personally sourced and underwrote" (vs Firmament team)

**NO public founder testimonials found**:
- Zero mentions in company press releases
- Zero LinkedIn acknowledgments
- Zero podcast/interview mentions
- All testimonials solicited for dataroom

**Implication**: Either:
1. Value-add is real but founders don't publicly acknowledge (unusual)
2. Value-add is exaggerated for fundraising purposes (red flag)

## Verification Plan

### 1. Dirac - Founders Fund Introduction (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Claim**: "Dillon introduced Dirac CEO Fil Aronshtein to 'friend at Founders Fund' in November 2023, helping create 'early awareness.' FF co-led $6M (or $10.7M) seed round in April 2024."

**Why Critical**: If true, demonstrates ability to make high-value VC introductions that directly result in funding. If false, major credibility concern.

**Verification Steps**:

**Option A: Contact Founders Fund Partner**
- Reach out to Trae Stephens (FF partner, likely Dirac sponsor)
- Questions:
  - "How did Founders Fund first learn about Dirac?"
  - "Did Dillon Dunteman introduce you to the company or CEO?"
  - "What role did Dillon play in your decision to invest?"
  - "Would you characterize your relationship with Dillon as strategic or transactional?"

**Option B: Contact Dirac CEO**
- Interview Fil Aronshtein (Dirac CEO) outside fundraising context
- Questions:
  - "How did you first connect with Founders Fund?"
  - "What role did Dillon play in the introduction?"
  - "Did the introduction materially impact the fundraise outcome?"
  - "Would you seek Dillon's help for future fundraising or hiring?"

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Verified**: FF partner or CEO confirms Dillon made introduction and it was material
  - **Implication**: Strong GP value-add signal → Raises confidence to proceed
  - **GP Value Score**: 8/10 (from current 6.5/10)

- ❌ **Not Verified**: Introduction didn't happen, or was immaterial
  - **Implication**: Serious dataroom credibility concern → Red flag
  - **GP Value Score**: 4/10 → Recommend pass

### 2. Normal Computing - Advisory Role & Hiring Referrals

**Claims**:
- "Dillon referred 2 key early hires in 2H 2023 - Q1 2024"
- "Helped with commercial strategy, financial modeling for Series A"
- "CEO offered advisory role with ~$80K equity award in July 2024 (double the $40K investment)"

**Why Important**: If true, demonstrates hands-on operational support and founder trust. Equity award double the investment is strong validation signal.

**Verification Steps**:

**Interview Normal CEO**:
- Contact Faris Sbahi (Normal Computing CEO)
- Questions:
  - "What specific help did Dillon provide during Series A fundraise?"
  - "Were the 2 hiring referrals successful? Are those people still with the company?"
  - "How would you characterize the quality of Dillon's strategic advice?"
  - "Is the advisory role active or ceremonial?"
  - "Would you seek Dillon's help for Series B fundraise?"

**Interview Referred Hires** (if CEO permits):
- Questions:
  - "How did you first hear about Normal Computing?"
  - "Did Dillon Dunteman refer you to the company?"
  - "What was the quality of his understanding of the role and company?"

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Verified**: CEO confirms high-quality hiring referrals and strategic support; advisory role is active
  - **Implication**: Strong operational value-add signal
  - **Confidence Level**: High

- ⚠️ **Partially Verified**: Some support provided, but impact unclear or advisory role is ceremonial
  - **Implication**: Value-add exists but may be overstated
  - **Confidence Level**: Medium

- ❌ **Not Verified**: Hiring referrals were poor quality or advisory role is nominal
  - **Implication**: Dataroom exaggeration
  - **Confidence Level**: Low → Red flag

---

### 3. Figure AI - Tamarack Global Relationship

**Claim**: "Dillon invested $40K in Figure AI Series A (April 2023) through 'close relationship with partners at Tamarack Global'"

**Why Important**: Tamarack is primary sourcing claim for portfolio's biggest winner (Figure 94x, >50% of value).

**Verification Steps**:

**Interview Tamarack Global Partners**:
- Contact Tamarack partners (identify via LinkedIn or Crunchbase)
- Questions:
  - "How would you characterize your relationship with Dillon Dunteman?"
  - "Was Dillon's $40K allocation in Figure AI material to his access, or one of many small checks?"
  - "Do you proactively share deal flow with Dillon?"
  - "Would you consider Dillon a strategic partner or a syndication participant?"

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Strategic Relationship**: Tamarack views Dillon as strategic partner, proactively shares deal flow
  - **Implication**: Repeatable access to high-quality deals
  - **Confidence Level**: High

- ⚠️ **Transactional Relationship**: Dillon participated in institutional round with many small checks
  - **Implication**: Opportunistic access, not proprietary
  - **Confidence Level**: Medium

- ❌ **Weak Relationship**: Tamarack doesn't view Dillon as strategic
  - **Implication**: Sourcing claim overstated
  - **Confidence Level**: Low

### 4. Quantinuum - Individual Attribution

**Claim**: "The first venture investment that I personally sourced and underwrote was CQC (Quantinuum) at Firmament in 2020"

**Why Important**: Quantinuum is second-largest winner (6.7x verified). Attribution claim (individual vs Firmament team) is unclear.

**Verification Steps**:

**Interview Quantinuum CEO** (outside fundraising context):
- Contact Ilyas Khan (Quantinuum CEO)
- Questions:
  - "How did you first connect with Firmament Group?"
  - "Was Dillon Dunteman the primary contact at Firmament, or part of a team?"
  - "Did Dillon personally source the relationship, or did Firmament as a firm?"
  - "Has Dillon provided value post-investment (M&A intros, investor intros, strategic guidance)?"
  - "Would you characterize your relationship with Dillon as active or passive?"

**Interview Former Firmament Colleagues** (if possible):
- Questions:
  - "What was Dillon's role at Firmament?"
  - "Did he lead the Quantinuum investment individually or as part of a team?"
  - "How would you characterize his contribution to the deal?"

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Individual Attribution**: CEO confirms Dillon personally sourced and led deal
  - **Implication**: Strong sourcing capability
  - **Confidence Level**: High

- ⚠️ **Team Effort**: Dillon was key contributor but not sole source/lead
  - **Implication**: Attribution ambiguous
  - **Confidence Level**: Medium

- ❌ **Institutional Credit**: Firmament team effort, Dillon role unclear
  - **Implication**: Claiming institutional credit as personal
  - **Confidence Level**: Low → Red flag

## Decision Framework

### If ALL 4 Verifications Pass
- **Confidence**: High (8/10 GP value score)
- **Recommendation**: Proceed to investment committee
- **Rationale**: Value-add claims substantiated, differentiation thesis validated

### If 2-3 Verifications Pass
- **Confidence**: Medium (6.5/10 GP value score)
- **Recommendation**: Proceed with caution, reduce commitment size
- **Rationale**: Some value-add exists but may be overstated

### If 0-1 Verifications Pass
- **Confidence**: Low (4/10 GP value score)
- **Recommendation**: Pass on investment
- **Rationale**: Dataroom contains material misrepresentations, credibility compromised

---

## Risk If Not Completed

**Investment Risk**: Proceeding without verification means investing based on unsubstantiated claims. If value-add is false:
1. Future fund performance may be luck-dependent (not repeatable)
2. GP may not be able to generate proprietary deal flow
3. Portfolio companies may not receive claimed strategic support
4. Differentiation thesis collapses → fund becomes commodity

**Probability Assessment**:
- **Value-add is real**: 60% (some evidence of tier-1 co-investors, but all claims unverified)
- **Value-add is overstated**: 30% (dataroom exaggeration for fundraising)
- **Value-add is false**: 10% (major fraud risk - unlikely but possible given funding discrepancies)

**Expected Value**: EV of verification = 0.3 * (avoid bad investment) + 0.1 * (avoid fraud) = **CRITICAL TO COMPLETE**

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 4 primary verification interviews completed
- [ ] At least 3 of 4 claims verified independently
- [ ] GP Value Score updated based on verification results
- [ ] Investment committee receives verification report
- [ ] Go/no-go decision made based on verification outcomes
