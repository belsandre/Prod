# HIGH-PRIORITY: Failed Investment Disclosure

**Priority**: HIGH (Pattern Recognition)
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Owner**: Investment Team
**Status**: Pending

---

## Executive Summary

The dataroom acknowledges 3 underperforming investments from 2020-2021, 1 company that "fire-sold for pennies on the dollar," and 2 shut-down companies. However, **none of these companies are named or detailed**. Understanding failure modes is critical for assessing GP judgment and fund risk.

**Recommendation**: Request names, dates, and post-mortems for all failed or underperforming investments.

### 2. Lessons Learned Validation

**Dataroom Claims**: "Learned lessons" from early failures

**Verification Required**:
- What specific lessons?
- How applied to later investments?
- Evidence of improved selection?

### 3. Portfolio Math Validation

**Current Understanding**:
- 16 companies with 15+ month holding period
- 12 marked up (75%)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Acceptable Response
- Names all failed investments
- Provides honest post-mortems
- Demonstrates learning applied to later investments
- Failures are reasonable given stage and sector

### Concerning Response
- Refuses to name companies
- Blames only external factors
- Cannot articulate lessons learned
- Failures suggest pattern of poor judgment

### Red Flags
- More failures than acknowledged
- Pattern of similar mistakes
- Losses larger than disclosed
- Recent failures not mentioned

## Pattern Analysis Framework

Once failures are disclosed, analyze for:

| Pattern | Question | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Sector concentration | Are failures in same sector? | Sector expertise gap |
| Stage concentration | All early-stage failures? | Selection or monitoring issue |
| Team pattern | Founder red flags missed? | Due diligence gap |
| Timing pattern | All same vintage? | Market timing issue |
| Amount pattern | Large or small checks? | Position sizing issue |
