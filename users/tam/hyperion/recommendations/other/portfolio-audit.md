## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: Request complete portfolio company list with verification documentation.

## Key Questions

   - Privacy concerns for certain companies?

2. **What is status of undisclosed 18 companies?**
   - How many are active vs shut down?
   - Any down rounds?

3. **How are markups determined?**
   - Latest round pricing?
   - Internal marks?
   - Third-party valuations?

4. **Are any investments written off but not disclosed?**
   - "2 shut down" mentioned - which companies?
   - Full writeoffs or partial?
