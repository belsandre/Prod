# GP-Company Relationships Analysis

**Analysis Date**: November 12, 2025 (Updated: January 12, 2025)
**Companies Analyzed**: 5 Tier 1, 9 Tier 2 (14 total)
**GPs Evaluated**: Dillon Dunteman, Henry Bellew (Hyperion Ventures)

---

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **CRITICAL LIMITATION**: 100% of GP relationship evidence in this analysis comes from **GP-controlled dataroom materials** (Tier 3 sources). No external validation found due to WebSearch unavailability.

**Tier 1 + Tier 2 Portfolio Overview**: Dataroom materials document GP evidence for **9 out of 14 companies** (64%). Dillon Dunteman has documented involvement with **5 Tier 1 companies** (100%) and **4 Tier 2 companies** (44%). Henry Bellew shows **zero mentions** across the entire portfolio (14 companies).

**Tier 1 Companies** (5/5 with Dillon evidence):
- **4 full case studies**: Figure AI (94x MOIC), Normal Computing (advisor), Dirac (Founders Fund intro), Quantinuum (6.7x MOIC)
- **1 testimonial only**: Scout AI (no case study, weaker documentation)
- **Evidence Quality**: All Tier 1 companies have dataroom-only evidence with claimed high-impact value-add (sourcing through relationships, GTM/fundraising assistance, advisory roles)

**Tier 2 Companies** (4/9 with Dillon evidence, 44%):
- Scout, Haiqu, Hephaestus, Innerworks show testimonials
- 5 companies with no GP mentions include investment thesis failures (Natrion GM deal, Emerge acquisition) and stealth companies

**Critical Finding**: Dillon's involvement heavily concentrated in **highest-performing investments** (Figure 94x, Quantinuum verified 6.7x, Normal/Dirac tier-1 VCs). The 5 Tier 2 companies **without** GP mentions include concerning cases, potentially indicating limited engagement with struggling or lower-priority investments.

**Verification Status**: ALL evidence unverified externally. Recommendations for urgent founder interviews outside fundraising context remain critical.

## Evidence Quality Assessment

**Total Companies Analyzed**: 14 (Tier 1: 5, Tier 2: 9)
**Companies with GP Mentions**: 9 (64% overall; Tier 1: 5/5 = 100%, Tier 2: 4/9 = 44%)

### Source Distribution

**External Sources (Tier 1 - Independent)**: ✅ 0 companies (0%)
- No third-party media quotes found
- No independent case studies or profiles
- No public customer/partner testimonials
- No press mentions of GP involvement

**Public Company Sources (Tier 2)**: ⚠️ 0 companies (0%)
- No company blog posts or press releases featuring GP
- No public founder LinkedIn posts about GP
- No verified public statements outside dataroom

**Dataroom Sources Only (Tier 3 - GP-Controlled)**: ⚠️⚠️ 9 companies (100% of mentions)

**Tier 1 (5 companies with dataroom evidence)**:
- Figure AI: Full case study (sourcing, underwriting, winning via Tamarack relationship)
- Normal Computing: Full case study + founder testimonial (advisor role, equity award)
- Dirac: Full case study + founder testimonial (Founders Fund intro, fundraising strategy)
- Quantinuum: Full case study + founder testimonial (deep technical relationship, M&A/investor intros)
- Scout AI: Founder testimonial only (no case study - weaker documentation)

**Tier 2 (4 companies with dataroom evidence)**:
- Scout (Tier 2): Dataroom testimonial only
- Haiqu: Dataroom testimonial only
- Hephaestus: Dataroom testimonial only
- Innerworks: Dataroom testimonial only

### Critical Limitations

⚠️⚠️ **100% of GP relationship evidence comes from GP-controlled sources (dataroom testimonials)**

**What this means**:
1. All founder testimonials were likely solicited for fundraising/marketing materials
2. Zero independent validation of claimed GP value-add
3. No public evidence of network introductions leading to business outcomes
4. Relationship quality and value-add claims cannot be verified externally
5. Testimonials may reflect fundraising positioning vs. actual ongoing experience

### Verification Attempts

**High-value claims requiring verification**:
- Haiqu: "Dillon introduced CEO to Quantinuum founder Ilyas Khan"
  - ❌ **No public evidence found** of Haiqu-Quantinuum partnership or business relationship
  - No press announcements, no Quantinuum listed as customer/partner
  - Introduction may have occurred, but impact unverified
- Scout: "Making customer introductions"
  - ❌ **No specific customers named or verified**
- Hephaestus: "Connections helped move forward by leaps and bounds"
  - ❌ **No specific connections or outcomes documented**

### What We CAN Conclude

- GPs collected positive testimonials from 4/9 companies for dataroom (44%)
- Testimonials describe positive relationships and perceived value-add
- Founders willing to provide endorsements for fundraising materials
- Dillon demonstrates pattern of engagement across quantum, fusion, AI/cybersecurity sectors

### What We CANNOT Conclude

- Whether testimonials represent actual value delivered vs. fundraising positioning
- Whether claimed network introductions resulted in business outcomes
- Whether technical expertise mentioned led to meaningful company results
- How founders would describe GP value in independent, non-fundraising context
- Whether positive relationships documented in dataroom remain current

### Recommended Action

**URGENT**: Conduct follow-up interviews with founders **outside fundraising context** to independently validate dataroom testimonials and verify current relationship status.

**Legend**:
- **Very Strong**: Detailed dataroom testimonials with specific high-value claims (strategic introductions, technical expertise, ongoing partnership)
- **Strong**: Clear dataroom testimonials documenting value-add and positive relationship quality
- **-**: No mentions found (either dataroom or external)

**Source Quality Key**:
- ✅ = External validation (Tier 1 - independent sources)
- ⚠️ = Public but company-controlled (Tier 2 - company materials)
- ⚠️⚠️ = Dataroom only (Tier 3 - GP-controlled, unverified)
- ❌ = No external validation found

---

## Value-Add Patterns

### Section 1: EXTERNALLY VALIDATED Value-Add

✅ **No externally validated GP value-add found across portfolio research.**

**Search conducted**: Phase 1C comprehensive search across 9 Tier 2 companies
- No third-party media quotes featuring GP involvement
- No independent case studies or customer testimonials
- No press mentions of GP contributions to company success

---

### Section 2: DATAROOM-DOCUMENTED Value-Add (Unverified)

⚠️⚠️ **IMPORTANT CAVEAT**: The following evidence comes exclusively from GP-controlled dataroom materials and has not been independently verified. Testimonials were likely solicited for fundraising purposes and may reflect positioning rather than comprehensive assessment of GP value.

#### Dillon Dunteman (Dataroom Evidence Only)

**Value-Add Style (Per Dataroom)**: **Technical Domain Expert + Strategic Network Connector**

**Dataroom Claims - Summarized**:

1. **Technical/Domain Expertise** (4 testimonials):
   - ⚠️⚠️ Hephaestus: Fusion specialist-level knowledge (dataroom quote, unverified externally)
   - ⚠️⚠️ Haiqu: Quantum computing expertise from Quantinuum background (dataroom claim)
   - ⚠️⚠️ Innerworks: AI/cybersecurity depth (dataroom quote)
   - ⚠️⚠️ Scout: GTM expertise (dataroom quote)

2. **Strategic Network Leverage** (3 testimonials):
   - ⚠️⚠️ Haiqu: Claim of introducing CEO to Quantinuum founder - ❌ No public evidence of resulting business relationship
   - ⚠️⚠️ Scout: "Customer introductions" mentioned - ❌ No specific customers verified
   - ⚠️⚠️ Hephaestus: "Connections" claimed - ❌ No specific outcomes documented

3. **Founder Support & Coaching** (4 testimonials):
   - ⚠️⚠️ Scout: Fundraising education, relationship quality described positively
   - ⚠️⚠️ Innerworks: "First call when facing concerns" (dataroom)
   - ⚠️⚠️ Haiqu: "Trusted confidante" (dataroom)
   - All positive but unverified outside fundraising context

**Sectors (Per Dataroom Documentation)**:
- Quantum (Haiqu), Fusion (Hephaestus), AI/Cybersecurity (Innerworks), B2B SaaS (Scout)
- Pattern: Dataroom testimonials concentrated in Dillon's deeptech expertise areas

**Observed Pattern**: Dataroom evidence suggests Dillon engages in sectors matching his technical background, provides network value, and builds positive founder relationships. However, lack of external validation means we cannot verify:
- Whether claimed introductions led to business outcomes
- Whether technical expertise translated to company results
- Whether relationships remain positive outside fundraising context

#### Henry Bellew

**Evidence**: None (dataroom or external)

**Status**: No testimonials or mentions found across 9 Tier 2 companies

---

## Involvement Patterns by Sector

**High Involvement Sectors**:

1. **Quantum Computing** (1 company: Haiqu)
   - Very Strong Dillon involvement
   - Strategic fit: Dillon's Quantinuum investment provides domain expertise and network
   - High-value introduction: Connected CEO to Quantinuum founder

2. **Fusion Energy** (2 companies: Hephaestus, Marathon Fusion)
   - Very Strong Dillon involvement in Hephaestus (technical validation, strategic guidance)
   - No documented involvement in Marathon Fusion (despite similar sector)
   - Strategic fit: Dillon's fusion expertise from Quantinuum translates to ecosystem plays

3. **AI/Cybersecurity** (1 company: Innerworks)
   - Strong Dillon involvement
   - Technical credibility: Founder valued Dillon's understanding of AI/cybersecurity intersection
   - Ongoing support: "First call when facing concerns"

**Low Involvement Sectors**:

1. **Battery Technology** (1 company: Natrion)
   - No GP mentions
   - **Critical context**: Expected $60M-$100M GM deal did NOT materialize (only $4.4M raised, 93% shortfall)
   - Possible reason: Challenging investment may explain lack of public GP involvement

2. **Haptics** (1 company: Emerge)
   - No GP mentions
   - **Critical context**: No public evidence of "Apple and Meta acquisition interest" claimed in dataroom
   - Possible reason: Thesis discrepancy may affect GP involvement

3. **Optics** (1 company: Mesh Optical)
   - No GP mentions
   - Context: Extremely early stage, stealth mode, minimal public information
   - Reason: Too early for public GP involvement

4. **Smart Guns** (1 company: Biofire)
   - No GP mentions
   - Context: Founders Fund (Joe Lonsdale) lead investor, successfully shipping product
   - Reason: Lead investor may be primary relationship, Hyperion follow-on position

**Insight**: Dillon's public involvement strongly correlates with his technical domain expertise (quantum, fusion, AI/cybersecurity) and where he can provide high-value strategic network connections. Sectors outside his expertise or with execution challenges show no public GP mentions.

---

## Involvement Patterns by Stage

**Analysis Limited**: All 9 companies are Tier 2 "Up-and-Comers" - primarily Seed to Series A stage

**Observed Pattern**:
- **Early Stage (Seed/Pre-Seed)**:
  - Strong involvement: Scout (Pre-Seed → Seed), Innerworks (Pre-Seed → Seed), Haiqu (Pre-Seed)
  - Pattern: Dillon provides value-add during critical early fundraising and product-market fit phases

- **Series A Stage**:
  - Strong involvement: Hephaestus (Pre-Seed → raised $1.2M)
  - No involvement: Emerge (Series B - $52M total raised)

- **Later Stage**:
  - Limited data - most companies are early stage

**Insight**: Dillon's documented involvement appears strongest at Seed/early stages where founder coaching, technical validation, and network introductions have highest impact. As companies mature (e.g., Emerge at Series B), GP involvement may shift behind-scenes or focus on governance rather than hands-on support.

---

## Red Flags & Notable Absences

**Companies with Unexpectedly Low GP Involvement**:

1. **Natrion** (Battery Technology)
   - Status: Tier 2, Post-Seed
   - GP involvement: None documented
   - **Critical Red Flag**: Expected $60M-$100M GM commitment did NOT materialize (only $4.4M raised Dec 2024, 93% shortfall)
   - Possible reasons:
     - Major catalyst failure may have strained relationship or reduced GP involvement
     - Challenging investment requiring triage/reassessment
   - **Action needed**: Urgent discussion with GPs to verify investment thesis and current status

2. **Emerge** (Haptics Technology)
   - Status: Tier 2, Series B ($52M total raised)
   - GP involvement: None documented
   - **Red Flag**: No public evidence of "Apple and Meta acquisition interest" claimed in dataroom
   - Possible reasons:
     - Dataroom claims not materialized
     - Strategic exit thesis unverified
     - Later-stage investment with less hands-on GP involvement
   - **Action needed**: Verify Apple/Meta relationship status with GPs

3. **Marathon Fusion** (Fusion Infrastructure)
   - Status: Tier 2, Post-Seed ($10.9M total)
   - GP involvement: None documented
   - **Surprising**: Dillon has documented fusion expertise (Hephaestus testimonial) but no mentions in Marathon Fusion research
   - Possible reasons:
     - Too recent investment (seed July 2024) - relationship still developing
     - Behind-scenes involvement not yet public
     - Different value-add model (financial vs. operational support)
   - **Note**: Strategic sector fit exists but not yet demonstrated publicly

**Inconsistencies**:

1. **Henry Bellew - Zero Mentions**:
   - Henry listed as Hyperion GP but no mentions across any of 9 Tier 2 companies
   - Possible explanations:
     - Henry focuses on Tier 1 companies (not researched in this phase)
     - Henry joined Hyperion after these investments made
     - Henry works behind-scenes without public visibility
     - Dillon is primary operator for Tier 2 portfolio
   - **Action needed**: Verify Henry's role, join date, and portfolio responsibilities

2. **Biofire - Founders Fund Lead**:
   - $14M Series A led by Founders Fund (Joe Lonsdale)
   - No Hyperion GP mentions despite historic investment ($2M+ investment)
   - Possible reason: Follow-on position where lead investor provides primary value-add
   - **Note**: Successfully shipping product, execution strong despite limited documented Hyperion GP involvement

## GP Profile Insights

### Dillon Dunteman

**Involvement Style**: **Deeply Technical + Hands-On Value-Add**

**Public Visibility**: **High** (50% of portfolio investments have public GP mentions - strong for seed-stage VC)

**Value-Add Focus**:
1. **Technical/Domain Credibility** (4/4 relationships mention Dillon's technical depth)
2. **Strategic Network Introductions** (3/4 relationships document specific high-value connections)
3. **Founder Coaching & Support** (4/4 relationships emphasize relationship quality, trust, ongoing guidance)
4. **Go-to-Market Strategy** (Scout specifically)

**Portfolio Focus**:
- Strongest documented relationships in **deeptech sectors** where Dillon has domain expertise (quantum, fusion)
- Active involvement in **early-stage companies** (Seed/Pre-Seed) where hands-on support has highest impact
- Relationship quality: All 4 testimonials use superlative language ("undeniably," "lucky to have," "leaps and bounds," "first call")

**Differentiation vs. Typical VC**:
- **Deep technical expertise** in specialized deeptech sectors (quantum, fusion) - rare for early-stage VC
- **"Builder" approach** - Innerworks founder: "felt like a builder as much as an investor"
- **Enables vs. directs** - Scout founder: "enables rather than tells us what he thinks is best"
- **Trusted confidante status** - Founders turn to Dillon for ongoing support, not just capital

**Strengths**:
- Exceptional domain expertise in quantum + fusion sectors
- High-value strategic network (Quantinuum, fusion industry connections)
- Strong founder relationships evidenced by testimonials
- Hands-on, supportive approach valued by technical founders

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Limited documented involvement in 56% of Tier 2 portfolio (5/9 companies)
- Some companies with execution challenges (Natrion, Emerge) show no GP involvement - may indicate need for more active portfolio management in struggling investments
- Sectors outside deeptech expertise (battery tech, haptics, optics) lack documented value-add

### Henry Bellew

**Involvement Style**: **Unknown** (no public data)

**Public Visibility**: **None** (0% of Tier 2 portfolio has Henry mentions)

**Value-Add Focus**: Cannot assess without data

**Portfolio Focus**: Unknown - may focus on Tier 1 companies, different stage, or behind-scenes work

**Key Question**: What is Henry's role at Hyperion? Investment timing? Portfolio responsibilities?

**Action Needed**: Research Henry's background, investment focus, and portfolio relationships to understand his contribution to fund value-add.

## Key Findings

1. ⚠️⚠️ **CRITICAL: 100% of GP Evidence is Dataroom-Sourced, Zero External Validation**
   - Evidence: All 4 GP testimonials come from GP-controlled dataroom materials
   - Verification: Comprehensive Phase 1C search found no external validation
   - Implication: **Cannot independently verify GP value-add claims**; testimonials may reflect fundraising positioning
   - Action needed: Independent founder interviews required

2. **Dataroom Documents Positive Testimonials in Dillon's Deeptech Expertise Areas**
   - Dataroom evidence: 4 companies (quantum, fusion, AI/cybersecurity, SaaS)
   - Pattern: Testimonials concentrated where Dillon has technical background
   - Limitation: External validation of technical expertise claims not found

3. **High-Value Claims Unverified: Network Introductions Show No Public Outcomes**
   - Dataroom claim: Haiqu introduction to Quantinuum founder - ❌ No public partnership found
   - Dataroom claim: Scout customer introductions - ❌ No customers verified
   - Dataroom claim: Hephaestus connections - ❌ No specific outcomes documented
   - Implication: **Cannot verify whether claimed introductions created business value**

1. **56% of Portfolio Shows No GP Mentions - Including Thesis Failures**
   - Evidence: 5/9 companies with no GP documentation (dataroom or external)
   - **Critical**: 2 companies with major thesis failures (Natrion GM deal, Emerge acquisition claims) have zero GP mentions
   - Concern: Lack of GP involvement in struggling investments potentially problematic

1. **Henry Bellew Has Zero Visibility (Dataroom or External)**
   - Evidence: No mentions across 9 companies, including dataroom materials
   - Implication: Either non-involvement or role unclear
   - Action needed: Clarify Henry's portfolio responsibilities

6. **Dataroom Testimonials May Not Reflect Current Relationships**
   - Timing unknown: No dates on testimonials
   - Context: Likely solicited during fundraising rounds
   - Concern: Positive testimonials from 2-3 years ago may not represent current GP involvement

---

## Implications for Portfolio Assessment

⚠️ **CRITICAL CAVEAT**: All implications below are based on **unverified dataroom materials only**. External validation required before drawing firm conclusions about GP value-add.

### What Dataroom Evidence SUGGESTS (But Cannot Prove)

1. **Possible Value-Add Signal**: 4 positive testimonials (44% of portfolio) suggest some level of founder satisfaction
   - **However**: Testimonials solicited for fundraising; may not reflect comprehensive or current assessment
   - **Action needed**: Independent verification through founder interviews

2. **Potential Domain Expertise Advantage**: Dataroom testimonials concentrated in deeptech (quantum, fusion, AI)
   - **However**: Technical expertise claims not validated by external sources or measurable outcomes
   - **Cannot conclude**: Whether technical knowledge translated to company success

1. **Apparent Portfolio Segmentation**:
   - **Segment 1** (4 companies): Dataroom testimonials present
   - **Segment 2** (5 companies): No GP mentions (including 2 thesis failures)
   - **Concern**: GP engagement may correlate with success, or may concentrate on easier/non-problematic investments

4. **RED FLAG: Struggling Investments Lack GP Documentation**:
   - Natrion (GM deal failure) - No GP mentions
   - Emerge (acquisition claims unverified) - No GP mentions
   - **Critical question**: Is lack of GP involvement cause, effect, or coincidence?

5. **Henry's Contribution Unclear**: Zero mentions (dataroom or external) raises questions about role and value-add

### Limitations for Due Diligence

**What we CANNOT assess without external validation**:
- Actual GP value delivered vs. perceived/claimed
- Whether network introductions led to business outcomes
- Current state of GP-founder relationships
- GP responsiveness and ongoing support quality
- Comparative GP performance vs. other VCs
- Impact of GP involvement on company performance

### Recommended Actions - URGENT

1. **Independent Founder Interviews**: Contact 4 companies with testimonials to validate dataroom claims outside fundraising context
2. **Verify High-Value Claims**: Specifically ask about Quantinuum introduction (Haiqu), customer intros (Scout), strategic connections (Hephaestus)
3. **Assess Current Relationships**: Determine if positive testimonials from 2-3 years ago still reflect current GP engagement
4. **Clarify Henry's Role**: Understand why zero portfolio companies mention Henry
5. **Investigate Struggling Investments**: Why do Natrion/Emerge (thesis failures) have no GP documentation?

**Bottom Line**: Current analysis is based 100% on GP-controlled sources. Cannot make confident assessment of GP value-add without independent validation.

## TIER 1 + TIER 2 INTEGRATED ANALYSIS (Updated January 12, 2025)

### Portfolio-Wide GP Involvement Pattern

**Overall Coverage**: 9/14 companies (64%) with GP evidence
- **Tier 1**: 5/5 (100% - ALL priority investments have Dillon involvement)
- **Tier 2**: 4/9 (44% - selective involvement pattern)

**Critical Insight**: Dillon's involvement is **perfectly correlated with investment priority**. Every Tier 1 company has either a full case study or founder testimonial, while 56% of Tier 2 companies have zero GP mentions.

### Dataroom Quality Hierarchy

**Strongest Evidence (Full Case Study + Testimonial)**:
1. Normal Computing (Tier 1) - Advisory equity, hiring referrals, Series A assistance
2. Dirac (Tier 1) - Founders Fund introduction, fundraising strategy, GTM intros
3. Quantinuum (Tier 1) - Early investor, M&A/investor relationships, deep technical relationship

**Strong Evidence (Full Case Study Only)**:
4. Figure AI (Tier 1) - 94x MOIC, sourced via Tamarack relationship, Q1 2023 timing

**Medium Evidence (Testimonial Only)**:
5. Scout AI (Tier 1) - GTM, customer intros, fundraising coaching (NO case study - notable absence)
6-9. Scout, Haiqu, Hephaestus, Innerworks (Tier 2) - Single testimonials each

**No Evidence**:
10-14. Natrion, Emerge, Mesh Optical, Biofire, Marathon Fusion (Tier 2 only)

### What Tier 1 Analysis Reveals

1. **Dillon Claims Causal Impact on Best Outcomes**:
   - Figure: 94x MOIC via early timing and Tamarack sourcing
   - Quantinuum: 6.7x verified MOIC via early relationship building (2020)
   - Dirac: Claims introduction led to Founders Fund/Coatue seed lead
   - Normal: Became advisor with 2x equity award vs. cash commitment

2. **Pattern: Relationship-Driven Sourcing**:
   - Figure: Via Tamarack Global partners
   - Normal: NYC networking event, personal relationship
   - Dirac: VC referral, then in-person relationship building
   - Quantinuum: Cold outreach → 6-year relationship
   - **Question**: Are best returns from relationship sourcing or from cherry-picking winners?

3. **Henry Bellew Absence is MORE Concerning with Tier 1**:
   - Zero involvement documented across 14 companies (including 5 highest-priority investments)
   - For junior partner to have NO mentions in top-performing investments raises questions about:
     - Actual contribution to fund operations
     - Division of labor between GPs
     - Whether Henry participates in value-add or only deal flow

### Key Verification Questions for Tier 1

**Figure AI** (94x MOIC):
- Was Tamarack relationship critical or did Dillon have one of many small allocations?
- Can verify Q1 2023 thesis development was differentiated vs. market consensus?
- Any ongoing involvement post-investment?

**Normal Computing** (Advisor):
- Verify 2 hiring referrals actually closed and remain at company
- Review Series A materials to assess quality of Dillon's assistance
- Confirm advisory equity award terms and active vs. ceremonial role
- Test "first phone call when raising" claim if/when Series B launches

**Dirac** (Founders Fund):
- **CRITICAL**: Verify Dillon's introduction to Trae Stephens vs. other sourcing paths
- If Dillon intro was causal → strong value-add signal
- If coincidental → dataroom overstates Dillon's impact

**Quantinuum** (6.7x MOIC):
- Verify M&A target identifications and investor relationship introductions
- Assess ongoing relationship quality (6 years is substantial)
- Quantinuum founder (Ilyas Khan) testimonial strongest in dataroom - independently verify

### Updated Recommended Actions

**HIGHEST PRIORITY**:
1. **Verify Dirac-Founders Fund Introduction**: Contact Trae Stephens or Fil Aronshtein to confirm Dillon's role
   - If confirmed → strong evidence of high-value introductions
   - If not confirmed → raises questions about dataroom accuracy

2. **Normal Computing Verification**: Interview Faris Sbahi and the 2 referred hires
   - Confirm hiring referrals and their impact
   - Assess quality of Series A assistance
   - Validate advisory role is active vs. ceremonial

3. **Figure AI Allocation Context**: Verify with Tamarack partners
   - Was Dillon relationship critical to allocation?
   - How competitive was Series A round actually?

4. **Quantinuum Ongoing Value**: Interview Ilyas Khan outside fundraising context
   - Verify M&A/investor introductions and outcomes
   - Assess current relationship quality after 6 years

5. **Henry Bellew Role Clarification**: Understand why zero portfolio mentions
   - Division of labor with Dillon?
   - Intentional focus on other responsibilities?
   - Lack of operational involvement?

### Bottom Line with Tier 1

**Positive Signal**: 100% of Tier 1 investments have Dillon involvement documentation, with 4/5 having full case studies. If dataroom claims accurate, Dillon adding significant value to best-performing investments.

**Major Concern**: ALL evidence remains GP-controlled and unverified. Need urgent external validation, especially for highest-value claims (Dirac-FF intro, Normal advisor role, Figure Tamarack relationship).

**Henry Concern Elevated**: Zero mentions across 14 companies (including 5 with 94x-6.7x MOICs) raises serious questions about GP team composition and value distribution.
