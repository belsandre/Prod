## Source Quality Targets

**Tier 2 Minimum**: 3+ high-quality sources

**Target Source Mix**:
- 1-2 High Objectivity: Funding databases (Crunchbase), news articles
- 2-3 Medium Objectivity: Company website, LinkedIn, product reviews
- Low Objectivity: Company blog, press releases (use for positioning only)

---

## Critical Evaluation Focus

### Key Skepticism Areas
1. **Seed Round Claims**: Excel projects $20M-$25M with VC preempt - verify if closed
2. **Customer Traction**: No customer names in available materials - find evidence
3. **Product Differentiation**: Claims AI-powered - what makes it unique vs incumbents?
4. **Valuation Trajectory**: $3.3M → $7.5M → $20M+ in 12 months - justified by traction?

### Red Flags to Investigate
1. **Not Featured in Case Studies**: Why absent despite 6.06x MOIC?
2. **Minimal Public Presence**: Very limited news, reviews, or market visibility
3. **Sales Platform in Deeptech Fund**: Strategic fit concerns
