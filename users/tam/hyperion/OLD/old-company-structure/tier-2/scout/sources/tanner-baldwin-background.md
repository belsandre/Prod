## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Strong domain expertise in sales (5+ years in sales leadership)
- Relevant experience at high-growth tech companies (Uber, CloudKitchens, Teamflow)
- Progression from IC → manager → head of sales → founder shows career growth
- Sales ops background valuable for building sales workflow tools
- Deep understanding of customer pain points (was the customer)

**Limitations**:
- No technical background (business degree, sales roles)
- First-time founder (no prior exits)
- Relatively young career (appears to be early 30s based on timeline)
- No formal product management or engineering experience
- Limited experience building/selling to enterprise (mostly SMB/mid-market)

**Verification Status**:
- University of Oregon degree: Verifiable through alumni records
- Teamflow employment: Confirmed via LinkedIn, consistent timeframe
- CloudKitchens employment: Confirmed via LinkedIn
- Uber/ZipRecruiter: Mentioned but dates unverified

**Assessment**:

Tanner Baldwin is a **sales-focused founder** with strong domain expertise in his product category. His background makes him well-suited to understand customer needs, build sales processes, and execute go-to-market strategy.

**Key strengths for building Scout**:
1. Deep understanding of sales workflows (5+ years doing the job)
2. Sales ops experience means he understands process efficiency
3. Buyer perspective - knows what sales tools fail to deliver
4. Strong network in sales community (likely helpful for early customers)
5. GTM execution skills from previous head of sales role

**Key risks**:
1. No technical background - must rely entirely on CTO (Artur Moczulski)
2. First-time founder - no experience building a company end-to-end
3. Sales background may lead to over-prioritizing customer requests vs. product vision
4. No experience selling to enterprise (Scout targets SMBs currently)

**Best use case for Scout's stage**: Tanner is ideal founder for building 0→1 product with strong product-market fit in SMB market. His sales background enables fast customer feedback loops and iteration. However, scaling to enterprise or building deep technical moats may require additional leadership.

## Relationship with Dillon Dunteman (from Dataroom)

**Founder Testimonial**: Tanner Baldwin's testimonial about Dillon (from priority-deals.md):
> "Dillon has been undeniably one of our most helpful investors, shaping our go-to-market strategy and making customer introductions. Dillon has helped us understand how investors think and how to efficiently raise capital. He is a great listener and understands the founder's perspective — he does everything he can to enable us rather than tell us what he thinks is best."

**Analysis of Relationship**:
- Focus on **GTM strategy** (aligns with both Tanner's and Dillon's expertise)
- **Customer introductions** (valuable for early-stage sales platform)
- **Fundraising education** (helps first-time founder navigate process)
- Dillon described as "great listener" and "understands founder's perspective"
- Relationship appears collaborative vs. directive

**Value-Add Match**: Dillon's help with GTM and customer intros is high-leverage for a sales platform founder who knows sales execution but needs broader network and investor relationships.
