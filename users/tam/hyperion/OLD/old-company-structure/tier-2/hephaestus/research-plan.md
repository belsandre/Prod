### Founder Testimonial
**Jack Zammattio, CEO & Co-Founder:**
> "Dillon not only 'got' the big picture of how our technologies differentiate us in the fusion industry, but he made several comments that only fusion specialists would even be aware of. At that point I was convinced that Dillon was cut from a different cloth, and I knew we would be lucky to have Dillon as a partner to Hephaestus. Dillon has since contributed an amazing amount in terms of ideas, strategies, and connections that helped Hephaestus move forward by leaps and bounds."
