**Source Type**: Company Website

**Objectivity Level**: Low

**Reliability Assessment**: Company-controlled marketing content. Useful for understanding company positioning, product features, and customer list, but all claims should be verified through independent sources. Website is professionally designed with substantive content. Customer list appears accurate (verifiable companies).

### Security & Compliance
- SOC 2 Certified
- ISO 27001 Certified
- AWS GovCloud (US) approved

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Customer list with verifiable company names (not just "Fortune 500")
- Specific security/compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) - verifiable
- AWS GovCloud approval indicates government customer capability
- Diverse customer base across multiple industries validates product-market fit
- Professional website with substantive technical content

**Limitations**:
- All product capability claims are company-asserted
- No customer testimonials or case studies on website (only logos)
- Time savings claims not quantified specifically
- No pricing information
- No revenue or business metrics
- Customer deployment status unclear (pilot vs. production)

**Biases**:
- Marketing content emphasizing benefits
- Selection bias - only positive framing
- Customer list may include pilots, not all production deployments

**Verification Status**:
- Customer companies are real and verifiable (Van's Aircraft, Ancra, Blue Origin, Siemens, etc.)
- SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications are verifiable (but not verified in this research)
- AWS GovCloud approval is verifiable
- Product capabilities: Demonstrated (customers exist) but performance claims not independently validated
- "Weeks to hours" claim: Company-asserted, not independently benchmarked

**Inconsistencies**:
- Website does NOT list Anduril, Stellantis, or Lockheed Martin (claimed in dataroom)
- This suggests those three are either (1) under NDA, (2) pilots not yet public, or (3) inaccurate dataroom claims

**Notable Absence**:
- No mention of Anduril, Stellantis, or Lockheed Martin despite dataroom claims of pilots with these companies
