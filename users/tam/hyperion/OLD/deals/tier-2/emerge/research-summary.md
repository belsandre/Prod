## Product & Technology

### Core Technology: Ultrasonic Haptics

**Wave-1 Device**:
- **Form Factor**: Tabletop device, approximately 13-inch laptop footprint
- **Technology**: Emits sculpted ultrasonic waves creating physically feelable force fields
- **Interaction**: Bare hands (no gloves, controllers, wearables required)
- **Sensing**: Multi-sensory inputs (touch, sight, sound, brain activity)
- **AI**: Emotion AI to digitize and transmit emotions in real-time

**Technical Approach**:
- Ultrasonic transducer arrays create mid-air haptic feedback
- Spatially modulated ultrasound creates tactile sensations
- Hand tracking enables interactive gestures
- Works across TVs, VR headsets (Meta Quest 2), AR platforms

### Product Evolution
**Timeline**:
- 2015-2019: Stealth development
- Nov 2019: Came out of stealth with Series A
- 2022: Beta launch with Meta Quest 2 support
- June 2023: Disney partnership announced
- Oct 2023: Sony partnership announced (mid-2024 commercial launch)
- 2024: Sony Bravia TV bundle deployment (planned)

### Competitive Differentiation

**Advantages**:
- Bare hands interaction (vs. gloves like HaptX, SenseGlove)
- Ultrasonic approach (vs. vibrotactile, air jets, wearables)
- Consumer focus (vs. enterprise/industrial haptics)
- Emotion AI integration
- Mass market distribution (Sony TVs vs. niche VR)

**Limitations**:
- Limited interaction volume (hands must be above device)
- Ultrasonic range constraints (physics-limited)
- Competing with "good enough" alternatives (controller vibration, hand tracking without haptics)
- Requires hardware purchase (vs. software-only solutions)

---


## Market & Competition

### Haptic Technology Landscape

**Consumer Haptics**:
- Game controllers (vibration feedback) - standard
- VR controllers (advanced haptics) - Meta Touch controllers, PlayStation VR2
- Haptic gloves - HaptX, SenseGlove, Meta prototype gloves
- Ultrasonic - Emerge (leader in consumer ultrasonic haptics)
- Wearables - bHaptics vests, Teslasuit

**Emerge's Positioning**:
- Most consumer-friendly ultrasonic haptics
- Bridging VR and mainstream (Smart TV deployment)
- Family/social focus vs. gaming/enterprise

### VR/AR Market Context (2023-2025)

**Headwinds**:
- Meta Quest sales slowing, Reality Labs losing billions
- Apple Vision Pro launched Feb 2024 but slow adoption ($3,500 price, limited apps)
- VR market growth stalling vs. earlier projections
- Consumer interest in metaverse declining

**Opportunities**:
- Haptics still underserved in VR/AR
- Smart TV market massive (1.3B devices) vs. VR (~20M annual sales)
- Sony partnership bypasses VR market challenges

### Competitive Dynamics

**Direct Competitors**:
- Ultraleap (mid-air haptics, enterprise focus)
- HaptX (gloves, enterprise/defense)
- bHaptics (wearables, gaming focus)

**Indirect Competition**:
- Meta hand tracking (no haptics but "good enough" for some use cases)
- Apple spatial gestures (Vision Pro, no haptics)
- Traditional game controllers with vibration

**Strategic Position**:
- Emerge differentiated by consumer focus + tier-1 partnerships
- Disney/Sony partnerships create moat (exclusive content/distribution)
- But: VR market struggles limit upside vs. earlier expectations

## Areas for Further Research

### High Priority (Verify Dataroom Claims)
1. **Apple/Meta Acquisition Interest**: Verify if discussions occurred, current status, or if claim was speculative
2. **Sony Launch Status**: Did mid-2024 Bravia TV launch occur? Sales/reception?
3. **Disney Deployment**: Which franchise? Timeline? Consumer availability?

### Medium Priority (Commercial Validation)
4. **Revenue/Traction**: Any disclosed revenue, unit sales, or user metrics?
5. **Wave-1 Pricing**: Consumer pricing and sales channel?
6. **Partnership Economics**: Revenue share, minimum commitments from Disney/Sony?
7. **Series C Plans**: Fundraising timeline, valuation expectations?

### Lower Priority (Strategic)
8. **Competitive Response**: How are Meta/Apple responding to Sony partnership?
9. **Content Pipeline**: Additional IP partnerships beyond Disney?
10. **International Expansion**: Markets beyond US?

## Investment Thesis Assessment

### Original Thesis (Inferred from Dataroom)
- Strategic exit opportunity (Apple/Meta acquisition interest)
- Consumer XR hardware play
- Disney/Sony partnerships provide validation and distribution
- $72M pre-money valuation (3x on $25M raised)

### Research Findings

**Supports Thesis**:
- ✅ Disney and Sony partnerships real and significant
- ✅ Technology validated by tier-1 partners
- ✅ Mass market positioning (Smart TV vs. VR niche)
- ✅ Differentiated IP access (Disney content)
- ✅ High-quality investor base

**Questions Thesis**:
- ⚠ **No evidence of Apple/Meta acquisition interest** (key dataroom claim unverified)
- ⚠ VR market headwinds reduce strategic value
- ⚠ Still in beta/early deployment (commercial scale unproven)
- ⚠ Long timeline to market (8+ years, patient capital required)
- ⚠ No disclosed revenue or traction metrics

**Risk Assessment**: **Medium-High**
- Strategic exit thesis unverified (no Apple/Meta evidence)
- Alternative exit: Sony acquisition or Disney partnership deepening
- Partnership model provides downside protection (distribution secured)
- But: Execution risk remains (beta → mass market transition)

**Recommendation**: **Monitor Sony launch success and verify acquisition interest claims** before considering follow-on. Disney/Sony partnerships valuable even without Apple/Meta acquisition, but strategic premium may be overvalued.

## Source Quality Analysis

### Medium Objectivity (3)
1. **Series A Funding Announcement** (BusinessWire, Nov 2019): Official press release with verifiable investors
2. **Sony Partnership Announcement** (PRNewswire, Oct 2023): Partnership validation from tier-1 brand
3. **Disney Partnership Announcement** (VentureBeat/Pirates&Princesses, June 2023): Multi-year strategic engagement

**Overall Quality**: Medium - Sufficient for partnership validation, limited for traction/revenue assessment

**Source Distribution**:
- ✅ Three independent announcements across 4 years
- ✅ Tier-1 partners provide credibility
- ⚠ All promotional content (press releases, announcements)
- ❌ No independent product reviews, customer testimonials, or traction data

**Information Gaps**:
- No revenue, sales, or user metrics
- No independent technology validation
- No customer testimonials or case studies
- Apple/Meta acquisition interest unverified
- Sony launch status (mid-2024) not confirmed

---


## Conclusion

Emerge represents a differentiated consumer haptics play with significant commercial validation from Disney and Sony. The technology enables bare-hands tactile interaction in virtual environments, addressing an underserved need in VR/AR and potentially mainstream Smart TV use cases.

**Strong positives**: Disney and Sony partnerships provide content, distribution, and tier-1 validation. The pivot to Smart TVs (1.3B devices) from VR (~20M headsets) is strategically sound given market conditions. High-quality investor base (Eric Schmidt, Vulcan, gaming founders) signals sophisticated backing.

**Key concern**: Dataroom claims "Apple and Meta acquisition interest" but **no public evidence found** in extensive research. This strategic exit thesis is unverified and may be speculative. VR market headwinds and long development timeline (8+ years, still in beta) add execution risk.

**Alternative value**: Even without Apple/Meta acquisition, Sony partnership provides mass market distribution path and Disney partnership offers unique content differentiation. Sony acquisition or deeper Disney integration are credible alternative exits.

**Investment assessment**: Partnerships validate technology and provide downside protection, but strategic premium ($72M on $25M raised) may assume Apple/Meta interest that is unproven. Monitor Sony commercial launch (mid-2024) and verify acquisition interest before considering follow-on.

**Tier 2 classification appropriate**: Strong validation (Disney/Sony) but unproven at scale; strategic exit thesis uncertain; alternative paths exist.
