# Hyperion Ventures I LP - Due Diligence Research

**Fund**: Hyperion Ventures I LP
**General Partners**: Dillon Dunteman, Henry Bellew
**Research Period**: January 6-17, 2025
**Last Updated**: November 17, 2025
**Overall Assessment**: **7.5/10 (Above Average / Strong with Significant Caveats)**

---

## Executive Summary

Hyperion Ventures I LP presents a **high-quality, highly concentrated deeptech portfolio** with exceptional paper returns driven by two major winners (Figure AI 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x verified). The fund demonstrates strong technical thesis coherence and tier-1 co-investor validation. However, **extreme concentration risk** (Figure AI represents >50% of portfolio value), **entirely unverified GP value-add claims**, **multiple funding discrepancies**, and **Henry Bellew's zero portfolio involvement** require extensive due diligence before investment.

### TL;DR: Investment Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Conditional on:
1. ✅ Verifying Dirac-Founders Fund introduction (critical GP value-add claim)
2. ✅ Resolving funding discrepancies (Dirac $6M vs $10.7M, Normal $17M vs $35M)
3. ✅ Independent founder reference calls (Normal, Dirac, Quantinuum CEOs)
4. ✅ Clarifying Henry Bellew's role and contribution
5. ✅ Deep dive on Figure AI valuation sustainability ($39B on minimal revenue)

**Best Case**: 9/10 (Figure executes, GP claims verify) → Top-decile returns
**Base Case**: 7.5/10 (Figure partially delivers, some claims verify) → Strong returns
**Downside Case**: 5.5/10 (Figure compresses 50%+, claims false) → Below average

## Current Status

### Portfolio Performance (Paper)
- **Claimed TVPI**: 6.7x net (77% IRR)
- **Verification**: Partially verified - based on unrealized markups, not exits
- **Top Performers**:
  - Figure AI: 94x MOIC ($40K → $3.76M on $39B valuation)
  - Quantinuum: 6.7x MOIC (verified, $10.6B valuation)
- **Concentration**: Figure represents >50% of portfolio value
- **Portfolio Size**: 24 companies, ~$1M deployed, avg check ~$42K

### Research Coverage

## Key Findings

### 1. Portfolio Quality: Strong but Extremely Concentrated

**Strengths**:
- Two exceptional winners validated by tier-1 co-investors (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos, Founders Fund, Coatue)
- Strong deeptech thesis coherence: "AI + hard science" convergence
- 71% technical founders (vs typical 40-50%)
- Early timing advantage: entered before 2024 mega-rounds

**Risks**:
- **Binary outcome risk**: Figure >50% of value → top-decile OR mediocre, low probability of average
- **Mark-to-market risk**: $39B valuation on minimal revenue, pre-revenue company
- **Competition risk**: Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics in humanoid robotics
- **BMW pilot not production**: Deployment status unclear

---

### 2. GP Value-Add: Entirely Unverified

**Critical Issue**: 100% of Dillon's value-add evidence comes from GP-controlled dataroom sources. **Zero independent verification** found despite comprehensive research.

**Claimed Activities** (all unverified):
- Dirac: Introduced CEO to "friend at Founders Fund" (Nov 2023) → FF co-led $6M seed
- Normal: Referred 2 key hires, advisory role with ~$80K equity award
- Quantinuum: "Personally sourced and underwrote" at Firmament (individual vs team attribution unclear)
- Figure: Sourced via "close relationship with Tamarack Global partners"

**Red Flags**:
- No public founder testimonials (press releases, LinkedIn, interviews)
- No independent VC confirmations
- All testimonials in dataroom only (solicited for fundraising)

**Verification Priority**: **CRITICAL**
- Contact Trae Stephens (Founders Fund) or Fil Aronshtein (Dirac CEO) to verify introduction
- Interview Faris Sbahi (Normal CEO) + referred hires to confirm value-add
- Verify Tamarack relationship depth independently

**Data**: [gp-profiles.json](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/_data/gp-profiles/) | [Claims Validation](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/claims-analysis/)

---

### 3. Funding Discrepancies: Credibility Concerns

**Critical Discrepancies**:

**Dirac**:
- Dataroom: $6M seed (April 2024)
- Public PR: $10.7M seed (April 2024)
- **Gap**: $4.7M (78% larger than claimed)

**Normal Computing**:
- Dataroom: $17M Series A (April 2024)
- Public sources: $35M total seed capital
- **Gap**: $18M OR round designation mismatch

**Implication**: If dataroom contains material misrepresentations for 2 of 5 tier-1 companies, what about other figures (valuations, check sizes, performance metrics)?

**Customer Claims Contradicted**:
- Dirac claimed "pilots with Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin"
- **NO public verification found** despite comprehensive research
- High-profile defense customers should have public announcements

**Verification Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Require explanation before proceeding

**Data**: [claims.json](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/_data/claims/) | [Red Flags Analysis](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/claims-analysis/#funding-discrepancies)

---

### 4. Henry Bellew: Zero Portfolio Involvement

**Critical Concern**: Co-GP Henry Bellew has **ZERO documented involvement** across all 14 researched companies, including 5 companies with exceptional MOICs (Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x).

**Absence Pattern**:
- 0/5 Tier 1 companies (0%)
- 0/9 Tier 2 companies (0%)
- No dataroom case studies
- No founder testimonials
- No mentions in external research

**Implications**:
- What is Henry's actual role and contribution?
- How is GP value distributed relative to contribution?
- Single point of failure if only Dillon engaged with portfolio
- Team lacks redundancy and coverage

**Verification Priority**: **URGENT** - Interview both GPs to understand division of labor

**Data**: [gp-profiles.json](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/_data/gp-profiles/#henry-bellew)

---

### 5. Thought Leadership Timing: Retroactive Framing Risk

**Timeline Analysis** reveals thought leadership may be retroactively constructed:

**Pattern 1**: Thought Leadership Follows Action
- Quantinuum investment: March 2020
- Substack launch: ~2021 (19 months AFTER)
- First article: October 2021
- Fusion article: April 2022 (fusion investment dates unknown)

**Pattern 2**: "Since 2019" Framing Contradicted
- LP Letter claims "early positioning since 2019"
- First investment: March 2020 (15 months after)
- Substack launch: ~2021 (24 months after)
- **Zero 2019 timeline events** support claim

**Pattern 3**: Attribution Ambiguity
- Dataroom: "Quantinuum was first venture investment I personally sourced"
- Timeline: Quantinuum was **Firmament institutional** investment (Dillon was employee)
- LP Letter: "Began angel investing mid-2022" (2+ years AFTER Quantinuum)

**Implication**: Substack appears to document investments retrospectively rather than develop theses prospectively.

**Data**: [timeline.json](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/_data/timeline/) | [Timeline Analysis](/hyperion/marketing-to-reality/objective-timeline/)

---

### 6. Network Quality: Strategic but Modest Connections

**Overall**: 637 LinkedIn connections, 27.5% VC (175 connections)

**Strategic Relationships** (high quality, low quantity):
- Vista Equity: 9 connections (former employer, LP base)
- Tamarack Global: 1 connection (primary Figure AI source)
- Founders Fund: 2 connections (claimed Dirac introduction)
- Coatue: 3 connections (claimed "close" strategic partner)

**Assessment**: Network appears quality-driven (strategic relationships) over quantity-driven (connection count). However, **limited connections to key claimed deal sources** (Tamarack: 1, FF: 2) relative to importance.

## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Investment Decision)

#### 1. Verify GP Value-Add Claims (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Action**: Independent validation of claimed value-add activities

**Specific Steps**:
- [ ] **Dirac-Founders Fund Introduction**: Contact Trae Stephens (FF partner) or Fil Aronshtein (Dirac CEO)
  - **If verified**: Strong signal of high-value VC introductions → GP value score 8/10
  - **If not verified**: Serious credibility concerns → GP value score 5/10

- [ ] **Normal Advisory Role**: Interview Faris Sbahi + 2 referred hires
  - Confirm hiring referrals quality
  - Validate Series A assistance (financial modeling, diligence, negotiations)
  - Verify advisory role (active vs ceremonial)

- [ ] **Figure-Tamarack Relationship**: Interview Tamarack Global partners
  - Was Dillon relationship critical to allocation?
  - Or one of many small checks in institutional round?

- [ ] **Quantinuum Attribution**: Interview Ilyas Khan (outside fundraising context)
  - Verify M&A/investor introductions
  - Assess current relationship quality
  - Clarify individual vs Firmament team attribution

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Owner**: [Investment Team]
**Link**: [Critical Verification Plan](/hyperion/recommendations/critical/verify-gp-value-add/)

---

#### 2. Resolve Funding Discrepancies (CRITICAL)

**Action**: Require written explanation for material discrepancies

**Questions for GPs**:
- Why does Dirac seed show $6M in dataroom but $10.7M in public PR?
- Why does Normal show $17M Series A vs $35M total seed in public sources?
- Are other dataroom figures (valuations, check sizes, performance) similarly misreported?

**If Unresolved**: Major red flag - cannot trust dataroom representations

**Timeline**: 1 week
**Owner**: [Investment Team]
**Link**: [Funding Discrepancy Investigation](/hyperion/recommendations/critical/resolve-funding-discrepancies/)

---

#### 3. Clarify Henry Bellew Role (URGENT)

**Action**: Interview both GPs to understand division of labor

**Questions**:
- What is Henry's specific role and contribution to fund operations?
- Why zero portfolio company involvement across 14 companies?
- What non-portfolio contributions justify GP economics?
- Is zero involvement intentional design or efficiency concern?

**Timeline**: 1 week
**Owner**: [Investment Team]
**Link**: [Henry Bellew Role Clarification](/hyperion/recommendations/critical/clarify-henry-role/)

---

#### 4. Figure AI Deep Dive (CRITICAL)

**Action**: Understand valuation sustainability and execution risk

**Key Questions**:
- Can Figure achieve <$20K unit cost at scale? (Currently unclear)
- BMW pilot → production deployment timeline? (Not yet production)
- Revenue model validation? (Pre-revenue, minimal traction)
- Competitive positioning vs Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics?
- Is $39B valuation justified on current progress?

**Deliverable**: Independent Figure AI valuation model and risk assessment

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Owner**: [Investment Team]
**Link**: [Figure AI Valuation Analysis](/hyperion/recommendations/critical/figure-ai-deep-dive/)

---

### High-Priority Actions (Due Diligence Phase)

#### 5. Portfolio Audit

**Action**: Request full 24-company list with investment dates, amounts, valuations

**Purpose**: Verify 6.7x TVPI claim independently (currently only 6 of 24 companies documented)

**Link**: [Portfolio Audit Plan](/hyperion/recommendations/high-priority/portfolio-audit/)

---

#### 6. Failed Investment Disclosure

**Action**: Request names, dates, post-mortems for:
- 3 underperforming investments (2020-2021)
- 1 company that "fire-sold for pennies on the dollar"
- 2 shut-down companies

**Purpose**: Assess failure modes and validate lessons learned narrative

**Link**: [Failed Investment Analysis](/hyperion/recommendations/high-priority/failed-investment-disclosure/)

---

#### 7. Fusion Investment Timeline

**Action**: Request investment dates for Zap, Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon

**Purpose**: Validate "early positioning" claim in fusion (article April 2022, but investment dates unknown)

**Link**: [Fusion Timeline Verification](/hyperion/recommendations/high-priority/fusion-timeline-verification/)

## Research Methodology

### Evidence Quality Framework (3-Tier System)

**Tier 1: Entity-Controlled Sources** (59% of timeline events)
- Dataroom materials (GP Bio, case studies, LP letters)
- GP-authored content (Substack articles)
- Solicited testimonials
- **Limitation**: Self-serving, unverified, potential bias

**Tier 2: Affiliated Sources** (5% of timeline events)
- LinkedIn profiles (self-reported but platform-verified)
- Resume data from known affiliations
- **Limitation**: Still self-reported, limited verification

**Tier 3: Independent Sources** (27% of timeline events)
- Public funding announcements (press releases)
- Third-party news (TechCrunch, Bloomberg, WSJ)
- Company websites (not GP-controlled)
- SEC filings, public records
- **Strength**: Independent verification, no GP bias

### Source Distribution Analysis

**High-confidence findings**: Multiple Tier 3 sources (company outcomes, public funding rounds)
**Medium-confidence findings**: Tier 1 + Tier 3 combination (investment timing claims)
**Low-confidence findings**: Tier 1 only (value-add activities, sourcing stories, referral volumes)

**Critical Gap**: 100% of GP value-add claims are Tier 1 only (dataroom testimonials) with ZERO independent verification.
