## Information Gaps

### Scout AI (Defense Robotics)

**Founders:** Colby Adcock (CEO), Collin Otis (CTO)
**Founded:** August 2024
**Description:** Defense robotics company with Fury VLA foundation model
**Location:** Sunnyvale, CA

#### Public Information (for context)
- **Funding**: $15M seed (April 2025) from Align Ventures, Booz Allen Ventures, Draper Associates
- **Product**: Fury VLA foundation model for defense robotics
- **Prototypes**: G01 (ground vehicle), A01 (aerial vehicle)
- **Customers**: Multiple DoD contracts secured

#### Information Gap
**Investment details not provided in dataroom:**
- Investment date (unknown)
- Investment amount (unknown)
- Entry valuation (unknown)
- Current MOIC/valuation (unknown)

#### Sourcing Evidence
- Mentioned in sourcing differentiation document with Scout AI logo and robotics description
- Distinct from Scout (Tanner Baldwin, sales platform) - different founders, different founding date, different product

#### Strategic Fit Assessment
- ✓✓ **Strong deeptech alignment** (defense robotics, AI foundation models, DoD contracts)
- ✓ Aligns with Hyperion's robotics thesis (Figure AI, Dirac cluster)
- ✓ Defense tech focus consistent with portfolio positioning

#### Next Steps
- Confirm investment exists and obtain details (date, amount, valuation)
- If investment confirmed, assess appropriate tier classification based on MOIC potential and strategic fit
- If no investment exists, clarify whether this is sourcing pipeline or data error

**Cannot assess tier priority until investment details confirmed.**

## Tier 3: TOP POSITIONS NOT FEATURED (Red Flags)

**Inclusion Criteria:** High MOIC (>3x) OR significant capital deployed BUT not mentioned in ANY narrative documents

**Target Size:** 2-5 companies
**Profile Depth:** Brief summaries with red flag analysis

**Why This Matters:** Companies with strong financial performance but absent from fundraising materials may signal weak founder relationships, underperforming expectations, strategic narrative misalignment, recent performance issues, or low GP engagement.

---

### 1. Pierisca (Jul-21)

**Financial Performance:**
- **Entry:** July 1, 2021 at $10M post-money valuation
- **Invested:** $62,500
- **MOIC:** 4.00x (Excel Dec-24E)
- **IRR:** 48.5% (Excel Dec-24E)
- **Current Valuation:** $40M (Excel Dec-24E projection)
- **Current Value:** $250,000
- **Rank:** **#5 by MOIC**, Top 10 by absolute value, Top 5 by capital deployed

**Excel Status/Notes:**
"Raised insider round w/ $19M val. cap; hitting technical milestones now to support assumed 2024 Series A at $40M val." (Source: Excel Dec-24E)

**Brief Description:**
Technology company (details not provided in documents). Has raised multiple rounds including insider round at $19M valuation cap. Currently hitting technical milestones to support Series A.

**Red Flag Analysis - Why Not Featured Despite Performance:**

**Documents Checked:**
- ❌ Pitch deck (Fund I): Not mentioned
- ❌ Case studies (Outperforming): Not included
- ❌ Case studies (Recent): Not included
- ❌ GP bio: Not listed in personal investments
- ❌ Founder references: No testimonial
- ❌ Sourcing differentiation: Not mentioned in network map

**Why Absent Despite 4.00x MOIC (#5 performer)?**
1. **Lack of founder relationship:** No testimonial despite being 3+ year investment (Jul 2021)
2. **Insider-only rounds:** Excel notes "insider round" suggests difficulty raising from new investors
3. **Technical execution risk:** "hitting technical milestones now" suggests delayed progress, may not have met original timelines
4. **Not thesis-confirming:** May not fit Hyperion's deeptech narrative (not quantum, not robotics, not energy)
5. **Modest absolute value:** While 4.00x MOIC is strong, $250K current value is smaller than Quantinuum ($1.74M) or ALL.SPACE ($368K)

**Circumstances:**
- Insider-only financing suggests challenges with external validation
- Technical milestones delayed but now achieving (per Excel notes)
- Two separate investments (Jul-21 $62.5K, Jul-23 $12K) show continued support despite challenges
- Series A projection ($40M) depends on technical milestone achievement

**Research Priority Level:**
**Medium** - Track technical milestone achievement and Series A fundraise success. Strong MOIC but relationship/narrative gaps suggest limited portfolio company value beyond financial return.

---

### 2. ALL.SPACE (Jul-20 Convert)

**Financial Performance:**
- **Entry:** July 1, 2020 at $51.3M post-money valuation
- **Invested:** $16,000
- **MOIC:** 5.85x (Excel Dec-24E)
- **IRR:** 48.0% (Excel Dec-24E)
- **Current Valuation:** $300M (Excel Dec-24E projection)
- **Combined Current Value:** $368,035 (combined with Series B tranche)
- **Rank:** **#4 by MOIC** (Convert tranche), **Top 5 by absolute value** (combined)

**Excel Status/Notes:**
"Raised Series C down round in 1H '23; assumes 2024 up-round to $300M given positive momentum in the business" (Source: Excel Dec-24E)

**Brief Description:**
Space/satellite company (based on name). Has multiple tranches (Jul-20 Convert at 5.85x MOIC, Aug-21 Series B at 1.28x MOIC). Raised down round in 1H 2023.

**Red Flag Analysis - Why Not Featured Despite Performance:**

**Documents Checked:**
- ❌ Pitch deck (Fund I): Not mentioned
- ❌ Case studies (Outperforming): Not included (despite 5.85x MOIC on early tranche)
- ❌ Case studies (Recent): Not included
- ❌ GP bio: Not listed in personal investments
- ❌ Founder references: No testimonial
- ❌ Sourcing differentiation: Not mentioned in network map

**Why Absent Despite 5.85x MOIC (#4 performer) and Largest Position ($368K)?**
1. **Down round red flag:** Series C down round in 1H 2023 is major negative signal
2. **Performance reversal:** Early tranche (Jul-20) at 5.85x MOIC, but later tranche (Aug-21 Series B) at only 1.28x MOIC suggests declining trajectory
3. **Largest single check ($215K Series B) now underwater on entry:** $235M entry, currently $300M = only 1.28x despite 3+ years
4. **No founder relationship:** Lack of testimonial suggests transactional relationship or founder dissatisfaction
5. **Strategic narrative fit:** Space/satellite may not fit "deeptech" narrative as cleanly as quantum/robotics/fusion

**Circumstances:**
- Down round (1H 2023) indicates business struggled to meet expectations
- Excel assumes "positive momentum" supports 2024 up-round to $300M, but this is speculative
- Large Series B investment ($215K at $235M valuation) now significantly underwater relative to expectations
- No evidence of value-add relationship or founder testimonial

**Research Priority Level:**
**High** - Largest absolute position ($368K) with major red flags (down round, no relationship, declining performance trajectory). Need to:
1. Verify actual 2024 up-round vs. $300M projection
2. Understand what drove down round
3. Assess whether to maintain position or seek liquidity
4. Determine if founder relationship salvageable or if this is purely financial hold

## Appendix: Data Quality Notes

### Valuation Discrepancies

**Figure AI:**
- Case study (April 2025): $39.5B
- Excel Dec-24E: $2.6B
- **Resolution:** Case study more recent, use $39.5B

**Quantinuum:**
- Case study (March 2025 secondary): $8.8B
- GP Bio: $10.6B
- Excel Dec-24E: $5.5B
- **Resolution:** Secondary market ($8.8B-$10.6B) vs. last institutional round ($5.3B Feb 2024)

**Marathon Fusion:**
- Excel shows both 1.00x MOIC at $13.9M and 3.59x MOIC at $50M
- Notes mention $25M preempted round
- **Resolution:** Need founder confirmation of current valuation

### Missing Companies in Excel

Several companies mentioned in founder references or case studies are **not in Excel portfolio:**
- Zap Energy ($1.1B valuation) - GP Bio, Fund I deck, founder reference
- Outtake ($16M Series A) - GP Bio, founder reference
- Valor Atomics (>$100M raised) - Founder reference
- Antithesis (>$80M raised) - Founder reference
- Archera (>$27M raised) - Founder reference
- Primitive Instruments - Founder reference, sourcing differentiation
- Haiqu ($10M seed, June 2025) - Recent case study
- Mesh Optical ($9M seed) - Recent case study

**Likely Explanation:** Personal investments outside of Hyperion Ventures I LP fund structure, or investments made via Hyperion Opportunity SPV SAFE rounds (per GP Bio disclaimer).

### Spelling Variations

**Pierisca vs. Piersica:** Same company appears with two different spellings in Excel (Jul-21 and Jul-23 tranches). Likely data entry inconsistency rather than separate entities (same Excel notes for both).
