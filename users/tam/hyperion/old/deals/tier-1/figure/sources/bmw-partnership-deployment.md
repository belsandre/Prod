## Customer Information

**Customer**: BMW Group (Fortune 500, Global 2000 automaker)
- **Status**: Tier 1 global OEM, premium automotive manufacturer
- **Deployment Stage**: Pilot testing phase, not full production deployment
- **Scale**: Single robot in body shop (as of March 2025 per BMW spokesperson)

**Signal Strength**: **MEDIUM-STRONG**
- Fortune 500 customer validation is significant
- However, deployment remains limited (pilot phase, single robot)
- No announced purchase agreement or production-scale deployment timeline
- BMW characterizes this as exploratory ("determining possible applications")

---

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Official announcement from customer (BMW), not just vendor claims
- Third-party validation of robot capabilities from reputable Fortune 500 company
- Specific task descriptions and performance requirements documented
- Real production environment testing (not lab conditions)
- BMW Board-level executive quoted, indicating strategic interest

**Limitations**:
- Deployment scale minimal (single robot in one body shop station)
- No financial terms disclosed (pilot vs. paid deployment unclear)
- No commitment to production-scale deployment stated
- Timeline for broader rollout undefined
- Performance metrics relative to human workers or traditional automation not disclosed

**Biases**:
- Both companies benefit from positive narrative (BMW: innovation leader; Figure: customer validation)
- Press releases emphasize potential and capabilities, minimize challenges
- Selective disclosure: successes highlighted, integration challenges or failure modes omitted

**Verification Status**:
- BMW partnership confirmed by multiple independent sources (TechCrunch, Forbes, Axios)
- Spartanburg location verified across sources
- Scale of deployment (single robot) confirmed by BMW spokesperson to media in March 2025
- **Discrepancy**: Brett Adcock claimed in late 2024 that robot ran "10 hours per day, every single day of production for five months," but this appeared to be from physical twin/mock-up facility, not actual BMW production line

**Inconsistencies**:
- **Deployment Scale Claims**: Adcock's social media posts suggest extensive deployment, but BMW official statements and spokesperson quotes indicate limited pilot (single robot as of March 2025)
- **Timeline**: Initial announcement January 2024, testing August 2024, but production deployment claims (Adcock) vs. reality (BMW) differ significantly
- **Future Plans**: No concrete timeline or scale commitments from BMW despite Figure's optimistic projections

## Raw Content

BMW Group Plant Spartanburg, South Carolina, and California robotics company Figure test the use of humanoid robots in production. Latest generation of robots, Figure 02, successfully completes testing in a real production environment.

Milan Nedeljković, BMW Board Member for Production: "With an early test operation, we are now determining possible applications for humanoid robots in production."

The BMW Group Plant Spartanburg and the California-based robotics company Figure are testing the use of humanoid robots in automotive production for the first time. The latest generation of robots from Figure, the Figure 02, has successfully completed testing in a real BMW production environment.

During the trials, the Figure 02 demonstrated particular tactile capabilities in the body shop, where it successfully inserted sheet metal parts into precise fixtures that are then assembled as part of a car chassis. The robot features advanced cameras, microphones, and sensors that enable it to perceive and understand its environment. With 16 degrees of freedom in each hand and human-equivalent strength, it can perform precision tasks requiring complex gripping and two-handed coordination.

The Figure 02 stands approximately 170 cm tall, weighs 70 kg, and can carry loads of up to 20 kg. It features threefold computing power compared to its predecessor, enabling it to process complex AI tasks autonomously.

The test operation is part of BMW Group's iFACTORY strategy, which focuses on efficiency, digitalization, and sustainability in production. The company is exploring how humanoid robots can take over ergonomically difficult tasks to relieve employees.

Both companies are currently analyzing the results of the test phase to determine potential future applications and integration requirements for humanoid robots in automotive manufacturing.
