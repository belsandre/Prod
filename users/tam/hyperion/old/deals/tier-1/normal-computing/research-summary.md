**Research Purpose**: Tier 1 Priority Company Assessment

---

## Executive Summary

Normal Computing is a seed-stage semiconductor AI company founded in 2022 by technical veterans from Google Brain, Google X, and Palantir. The company has two core products: (1) Normal EDA, an AI-powered platform for semiconductor verification and testing, and (2) Normal ASICs, thermodynamic computing hardware targeting dramatic energy efficiency improvements for AI workloads.

**Key Highlights**:
- Raised $35M in total seed capital from high-quality investors (Eric Schmidt/FSV, Celesta, Drive Capital, Micron Ventures, Samsung Next, Intel Ignite, ARIA)
- Successfully taped out CN101, claimed as world's first thermodynamic computing chip (August 2025)
- CEO Faris Sbahi has exceptional technical credentials (Duke valedictorian, triple major, ex-Google X researcher)
- Claims Fortune 500 semiconductor customers for EDA platform (unverified)
- ~30 employees across 4 global offices (NYC, SF, London, Copenhagen)

**Major Red Flags / Inconsistencies**:
1. **FUNDING DISCREPANCY**: Dataroom claims "$17M Series A (April 2024) led by Drive Capital" but NO public announcement found. Public sources show $35M total SEED capital, not Series A.
2. **CUSTOMER CLAIMS UNVERIFIED**: Claims "Fortune 500 companies use Normal EDA" and dataroom states "Micron indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR" but NO independent verification. Micron Ventures is an INVESTOR, not confirmed as customer.
3. **PERFORMANCE CLAIMS ASPIRATIONAL**: "1000x energy efficiency" and "2x faster time-to-market" are company projections, not demonstrated results.

**Overall Assessment**: Strong technical team with impressive credentials and solid investor backing, but funding details are unclear/inconsistent with dataroom, and commercial traction claims lack independent verification. First-time founder with unproven commercial operating track record. High technical risk (thermodynamic computing is novel/unproven) and execution risk.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Funding Details Are Inconsistent with Dataroom Claims
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (factual discrepancy with public record)

**Evidence from Interested Parties** (Dataroom):
- Priority deals document states: "$17M Series A raised (April 2024) led by Drive Capital"
- Investment structure: "~$80,000 equity award (advisory role, in lieu of ~$40,000 Series A investment) (July 2024)"
- Excel status: "Not listed in Excel portfolio (investment via Hyperion Opportunity SPV SAFE rounds per GP Bio disclaimer)"

**Independent Verification** (Public Sources):
- PR Newswire (June 2023): "$8.5M seed funding closed January 2023" led by Celesta Capital and First Spark Ventures, with Micron Ventures participating
- Company blog post (2025): "$35M in total seed capital" from Eric Schmidt (FSV), Celesta, Drive Capital, ARIA, Micron Ventures, Samsung Next, Intel Ignite, NSIN
- NO public announcement found for "$17M Series A in April 2024"
- Drive Capital IS mentioned as investor but in context of $35M total seed, not separate Series A

**Analysis**:
The dataroom's claim of a "$17M Series A led by Drive Capital in April 2024" is NOT corroborated by any public sources. Possible explanations:
1. Confidential Series A not yet publicly announced (unlikely given 7+ months elapsed)
2. Dataroom information is incorrect/outdated
3. Confusion between $35M total seed capital and a Series A round
4. Internal Hyperion classification differs from public fundraise nomenclature

Drive Capital IS an investor per company blog, but timing and round designation unclear. The $35M total seed capital likely represents multiple closes/tranches: $8.5M initial (Jan 2023) + $26.5M follow-on (timing unclear, may include April 2024 tranche that dataroom calls "Series A").

**Recommendation**: Clarify with founder (Faris Sbahi) or lead investor actual fundraise structure, timing, and valuation.

---

### Finding 2: Fortune 500 Customer Claims Lack Independent Verification
**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM (claims from interested parties, no independent confirmation)

**Claims from Interested Parties**:
- Company website: "Leading semiconductor companies (Fortune 500 level) use Normal EDA to scale hardware development"
- Seed funding PR (June 2023): "Initiating pilots with Fortune 500 companies across semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain management, banking, and government agencies"
- Company blog: "Fortune 500 companies use our AI systems to scale new hardware and enable faster time-to-market"
- Dataroom: "Micron and F500 firms indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR each for platform"

**Independent Verification**: NONE FOUND
- No customer case studies, testimonials, or references published
- No third-party articles mentioning Normal Computing customers
- No customer logos or names disclosed publicly
- Micron Ventures is an INVESTOR (financial stakeholder), NOT confirmed as customer

**Analysis**:
The company consistently claims Fortune 500 customers/pilots but provides NO specifics (names, contract values, deployment status). The June 2023 PR states "initiating pilots" which suggests early-stage engagement, not revenue-generating customers.

The dataroom's claim that "Micron indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR" is particularly problematic:
- Micron Ventures invested in Normal Computing (financial interest = bias)
- "Indicated willingness to pay" ≠ signed contract or revenue
- $10M+ ARR claim is not independently verified
- No evidence Micron is actually a paying customer

**Key Question**: Are there ANY paying customers, or only pilots/POCs? What is actual ARR?

**Recommendation**: Request customer references, signed contracts/LOIs, and actual ARR/revenue figures. Verify Micron relationship: investor only vs. customer vs. both?

---

### Finding 3: Thermodynamic Computing Chip (CN101) Tape-Out Achieved But Performance Unproven
**Confidence Level**: HIGH for tape-out milestone, LOW for performance claims

**Verified Facts**:
- CN101 successfully taped out (August 2025) - announced via PR Newswire
- First generation of thermodynamic computing architecture
- Technical approach: Physics-based ASIC leveraging randomness, metastability, stochasticity
- Roadmap exists for CN201 (2026) and CN301 (2027-2028)

**Unverified Claims**:
- "Up to 1000x energy consumption efficiency on targeted AI and scientific workloads" - ASPIRATIONAL TARGET, not demonstrated
- "Low-latency, high-throughput performance" - CLAIMED, not benchmarked
- "World's first thermodynamic computing chip" - May be definitionally true but hard to verify (depends on how "thermodynamic computing" is defined)

**Analysis**:
Tape-out is a significant technical milestone indicating real progress in chip development. However:
- Tape-out ≠ working product (still needs fabrication, testing, validation, debugging)
- Performance claims are projections/"targets" not actual measured results
- "Up to 1000x" is marketing language with heavy caveats ("on targeted workloads" = cherry-picked scenarios)
- No independent benchmarking or third-party validation
- Thermodynamic computing is highly novel/experimental technology with unproven commercial viability

**Key Questions**:
- When will actual silicon return from fab?
- What are realistic timelines for product availability?
- What workloads actually benefit? What workloads don't?
- How does it compare to GPUs/TPUs on real-world AI tasks?

**Recommendation**: Track CN101 testing results and independent benchmarks once available. Assess commercial traction: do customers commit to using CN101, or is it science project?

---

### Finding 4: CEO Faris Sbahi Has Exceptional Technical Credentials But Limited Operating Experience
**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Strengths** (Verified):
- Duke University valedictorian, triple major (Physics, CS, Math)
- Ex-Google X Research Scientist (quantum computing, probabilistic AI)
- Contributed to TensorFlow Probability and TensorFlow Quantum frameworks
- Google Scholar shows collaborations with top institutions (IBM Quantum, Los Alamos, Princeton)
- Successfully raised $35M seed from high-quality investors
- Strong technical reputation per Dillon Dunteman testimonial
- Built team of ~30 FTEs and 4 global offices within 3 years

**Weaknesses/Risks**:
- First-time founder (no prior company exits)
- Relatively young (likely late 20s, graduated ~2018-2020)
- Limited prior leadership/management experience before CEO role
- No track record scaling companies to $100M+ revenue or profitability
- Unproven commercial operator (technical founder, not business/sales background)

**Analysis**:
Faris is a "technical founder par excellence" with world-class credentials in quantum computing and AI. His Google X pedigree and TensorFlow framework contributions demonstrate serious technical depth. However, building and scaling a commercial semiconductor company requires:
- Enterprise sales capability (selling into F500 semiconductor companies)
- Operational excellence (managing global team, product development, go-to-market)
- Capital efficiency and path to profitability
- Navigating complex semiconductor industry dynamics

As a first-time founder in late 20s, Faris has not yet proven these commercial/operational capabilities. The strong testimonial from Dillon Dunteman ("founder-first tact", "rare investor", "will always be one of my first phone calls") suggests:
1. Faris values and is receptive to investor guidance
2. He needed significant help ("clearing his weekend to help on strategy, talent, and other critical initiatives")
3. Strong investor-founder relationship

**Key Question**: Is Faris coachable and surrounding himself with experienced operators/advisors, or is he a brilliant technical founder who may struggle with commercial execution?

**Recommendation**: Assess quality of executive team, advisors, and board. Evaluate go-to-market strategy and sales pipeline. Look for signs of commercial maturity (signed contracts, revenue, customer references).

---

### Finding 5: Investor Base Is High-Quality But Largely Strategic/Deeptech Focused
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (investor list is factual)

**Investor List**:
- Eric Schmidt (First Spark Ventures) - High-profile, brings credibility and network
- Celesta Capital - Deeptech/semiconductor focused VC
- Drive Capital - Midwest-based VC
- Micron Ventures - Strategic investor (memory/semiconductor giant)
- Samsung Next - Strategic investor (Samsung corporate VC)
- Intel Ignite - Strategic investor (Intel accelerator program)
- UK ARIA - Government innovation agency
- National Security Innovation Network - Government/defense focused

**Analysis**:
Strong investor base with mix of:
1. High-profile individual (Eric Schmidt)
2. Deeptech-focused VCs (Celesta, FSV)
3. Strategic investors with semiconductor expertise (Micron, Samsung, Intel)
4. Government/defense support (ARIA, NSIN)

This investor profile suggests:
- Strong validation of technical approach
- Strategic alignment with semiconductor industry
- Potential customer development support from strategics
- Government/defense interest (may open procurement channels)

However:
- Strategic investors can be slow/bureaucratic as customers
- Heavy strategic presence may complicate exit dynamics (M&A preferences vs. IPO)
- Lack of top-tier traditional VCs (Sequoia, a16z, Founders Fund) may indicate:
  - Passed on deal due to risk profile
  - Haven't yet engaged (too early stage)
  - Company chose strategic investors over traditional VCs

**Recommendation**: Understand investor dynamics and board composition. Are strategics helpful or constraining? What are exit expectations?

## Inconsistencies & Unresolved Questions

### Major Inconsistency: Funding Details
**Inconsistency**: Dataroom claims "$17M Series A (April 2024) led by Drive Capital" but public sources show "$35M total seed capital" with no Series A announcement.

**Sources in Conflict**:
- Dataroom (interested party): "$17M Series A (April 2024), Drive Capital lead"
- PR Newswire (medium objectivity): "$8.5M seed (January 2023), Celesta/FSV leads"
- Company blog (low objectivity): "$35M total seed, multiple investors including Drive Capital"

**Likely Explanation**: The $35M "total seed capital" likely includes multiple tranches/closes. The April 2024 raise that dataroom calls "Series A" may actually be a seed extension or final close of expanded seed round. Drive Capital may have led a later tranche.

**Confidence**: HIGH that there is confusion/inconsistency. Series A designation not verified publicly.

**Resolution Needed**: Contact Faris Sbahi or Drive Capital to clarify actual fundraise structure.

---

### Major Inconsistency: Micron Customer vs. Investor Relationship
**Inconsistency**: Dataroom claims "Micron indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR" but public sources only confirm Micron Ventures as investor.

**Sources**:
- Dataroom (interested party): "Micron and F500 firms indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR each for platform"
- PR Newswire/company sources (medium/low objectivity): "Micron Ventures" as investor, no mention of customer relationship

**Analysis**: Micron Ventures (corporate VC arm) investing ≠ Micron as customer. "Indicated willingness to pay" is not a signed contract. This appears to be conflating investor interest with customer interest.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM that Micron is NOT yet a paying customer, only an investor with potential customer interest.

**Resolution Needed**: Clarify Micron relationship. Get customer contract evidence if exists.

---

### Unresolved Question: What is Actual ARR?
**Question**: Does Normal Computing have ANY paying customers, or only pilots/POCs? What is actual annual recurring revenue?

**Evidence**:
- June 2023 PR: "Initiating pilots" (suggests no revenue yet)
- Company claims: "Fortune 500 companies use our AI systems" (present tense, but unverified)
- Dataroom: "Indicated willingness to pay $10M+ ARR" (future tense, not current)

**Assessment**: Likely still in pilot phase with no or minimal revenue as of mid-2023. Current status (late 2025) unknown.

**Resolution Needed**: Request actual ARR figure and breakdown of paying customers vs. pilots.

---
