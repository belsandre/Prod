# Portfolio Quality Assessment

**Assessment Date**: January 12, 2025
**Portfolio Scope**: 5 Tier 1 companies, 9 Tier 2 companies (14 total)
**GPs Assessed**: Dillon Dunteman, Henry Bellew
**Fund**: Hyperion Ventures I LP

---

## Executive Summary

Hyperion Ventures I LP demonstrates a **high-quality, highly concentrated deeptech portfolio** with exceptional paper returns driven by two massive winners (Figure AI 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x verified) and promising emerging companies. The portfolio shows strong technical thesis coherence (quantum, robotics, AI/semiconductors, fusion), tier-1 co-investor validation, and claimed GP value-add across priority investments.

**Key Strengths**:
- **Outlier Returns**: Figure AI (94x MOIC, $39.5B valuation) represents top-decile VC outcome
- **Technical Depth**: Portfolio concentrated in cutting-edge deeptech (quantum, humanoid robotics, thermodynamic chips, fusion)
- **Co-Investor Quality**: Founders Fund, Coatue, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos backing validates thesis
- **GP Involvement**: 100% of Tier 1 investments have documented Dillon involvement with claimed value-add

**Key Concerns**:
- **Concentration Risk**: 2 companies (Figure, Quantinuum) drive majority of portfolio value
- **Valuation Risk**: Figure's $39.5B valuation on minimal revenue creates significant markto-market exposure
- **Verification Gap**: ALL GP value-add evidence from unverified dataroom sources
- **Investment Thesis Failures**: 2 Tier 2 companies show concerning red flags (Natrion GM deal, Emerge acquisition claims)
- **Henry Bellew**: Zero documented involvement across 14 companies raises GP team composition questions

**Overall Portfolio Quality Score**: **8.0/10** (Strong, with caveats)

**Assessment**: IF dataroom claims verify and IF Figure AI executes to valuation, this is an exceptional portfolio. However, extreme concentration in one unproven $39B company and lack of external GP validation create significant due diligence requirements.

**Analysis**: Portfolio shows strong thematic coherence in deeptech/AI with diversification across 11 distinct sectors. Quantum (14%) and Sales/GTM AI (14%) have modest concentration. No single sector dominates, reducing sector-specific risk.

### Stage Distribution

| Stage          | Count | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Notes                                                       |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Late Growth    | 2     | 2      | 0      | Figure ($39.5B), Quantinuum ($8.8B) - majority portfolio value |
| Series A       | 3     | 1      | 2      | Normal (preparing Series B), Hephaestus, Innerworks         |
| Seed           | 3     | 1      | 2      | Dirac, Haiqu, Marathon Fusion                               |
| Pre-Seed       | 6     | 1      | 5      | Scout AI, Scout, Natrion, Emerge, Mesh Optical, Biofire     |

**Analysis**: Portfolio tilted toward early-stage (64% Seed/Pre-Seed), which is appropriate for first-time fund. Two late-stage companies (Figure, Quantinuum) provide outsized current value but were early-stage at entry.

### Geographic Distribution

**US-Based**: 14/14 companies (100%)
- **California**: Figure (Sunnyvale), Normal (Palo Alto) - 2 companies
- **New York**: Dirac, Scout AI, others - concentration in NYC deeptech ecosystem
- **Massachusetts**: Quantinuum (Broomfield, CO headquarters but operations in MA)
- **Distributed**: Across US deeptech hubs

**Analysis**: 100% US concentration reduces currency/geopolitical risk but limits exposure to international deeptech ecosystems (UK, Israel, China).

### Vintage Distribution

| Vintage    | Count | Companies                                                        |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2020-2021  | 1     | Quantinuum (March 2020 - Firmament predecessor investment)       |
| 2023       | 4     | Figure (April 2023), Scout AI (April 2023), Normal (2023), others |
| 2024       | 6     | Dirac (Q4 2023/Q1 2024), Haiqu, Mesh Optical, Scout, others     |
| 2025       | 3     | Recent additions (Marathon Fusion, others)                       |

**Analysis**: Majority of portfolio deployed 2023-2024 (vintage 1-2 years old). Early to assess performance, but Figure/Quantinuum early entries showing exceptional timing.

## Performance Assessment

### Winners (Strong Performers)

#### Figure AI (Tier 1) - **PORTFOLIO CHAMPION**
- **Performance Signals**: $420M → $39.5B valuation (94x MOIC), ~$2B raised, BMW deployment, 310 FTEs
- **Evidence**: Series C at $39B with tier-1 backing (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos, Brookfield)
- **MOIC**: 94.05x (dataroom) on $40K investment = $3.76M current value
- **Why Winning**: First-mover commercial deployment (BMW), exceptional team (Tesla/Boston Dynamics/DeepMind), massive market tailwinds (labor shortages + AI breakthroughs)
- **Risk**: Pre-revenue/minimal revenue at $39B valuation creates extreme mark-to-market risk

#### Quantinuum (Tier 1) - **VALIDATED WINNER**
- **Performance Signals**: $244M → $8.8B valuation (verified), full-stack quantum leader, 550 FTEs, F500 customers (IBM, JPMorgan, Mitsui)
- **Evidence**: $300M Series raise (Feb 2024) at $5.3B, secondary at $8.8B (March 2025)
- **MOIC**: 6.7x verified (Dillon's personal portfolio from Firmament predecessor)
- **Why Winning**: Market leadership in quantum computing, Honeywell merger created scale, strong F500 customer base
- **Risk**: Quantum commercialization timeline uncertain, but company well-capitalized

#### Normal Computing (Tier 1) - **EMERGING WINNER**
- **Performance Signals**: Preparing $50M+ Series B, Q1 2025 F500 semiconductor customer agreements, ~30 FTEs
- **Evidence**: Series A $17M (Drive Capital lead), "preempt interest from several top VCs" per dataroom
- **Investment**: ~$80K advisor equity (unusual structure suggests high CEO valuation of Dillon)
- **Why Winning**: Dual revenue streams (thermodynamic AI chips + agentic verification software), Micron customer relationship, validated product-market fit
- **Risk**: Complex technology (thermodynamic chips unproven at scale), competitive semiconductor market

#### Dirac (Tier 1) - **STRONG EARLY TRACTION**
- **Performance Signals**: Founders Fund + Coatue co-led $6M seed (April 2024), pilots with Anduril/Stellantis/Lockheed Martin (2025), 14 FTEs
- **Evidence**: Tier-1 VC backing validates thesis, defense/aerospace pilots indicate product-market fit
- **Investment**: $20K pre-seed ($15M cap), likely strong MOIC given FF/Coatue lead
- **Why Winning**: AI-powered manufacturing instructions solve real pain point, LLM breakthrough enabler, strong founder (Fil Aronshtein)
- **Risk**: Narrow use case (manufacturing instructions), competitive moat unclear

**Summary**: 4/14 companies (29%) showing strong performance signals. Figure + Quantinuum drive majority of current portfolio value (~$3.76M + verified returns from Quantinuum).

### Steady Performers

#### Scout AI (Tier 1) - **MODERATE TRACTION**
- **Performance Signals**: 2 pre-seed rounds ($15K + $23K), product launched, early customer traction
- **Evidence**: Founder testimonial (positive relationship), GTM focus
- **Why Steady**: B2B sales platform addressing real need, but limited public validation, no major funding announcements
- **Risk**: Competitive sales AI market, unclear differentiation

#### Haiqu, Hephaestus, Innerworks (Tier 2) - **EARLY-STAGE PROGRESS**
- **Performance Signals**: Seed raises completed, founder testimonials positive
- **Evidence**: Dataroom testimonials document Dillon involvement
- **Why Steady**: Still in early product development, too soon to assess performance
- **Risk**: Standard early-stage execution risk

### Strugglers / Red Flags

#### Natrion (Tier 2) - **INVESTMENT THESIS FAILURE**
- **Concerning Signals**: GM customer claim NOT verified, conflicting information (investor vs. customer relationship)
- **Evidence**: Research uncovered GM is investor (GM Ventures), not customer. Dataroom claim of "GM deal" appears misleading.
- **Risk Assessment**: Credibility concern. Misleading dataroom representation raises questions about other portfolio company claims.
- **Mitigation Factors**: None identified. Absence of GP involvement (no testimonial/case study) suggests limited Hyperion engagement.

#### Emerge (Tier 2) - **UNVERIFIED ACQUISITION CLAIMS**
- **Concerning Signals**: Dataroom claims Apple/Meta acquisition interest, but NO public evidence found
- **Evidence**: Zero press mentions of Emerge, no validation of acquisition conversations
- **Risk Assessment**: Unsubstantiated claims. If false, raises serious dataroom credibility questions.
- **Mitigation Factors**: None. No GP involvement documented (no testimonial/case study).

#### Scout (Tier 2) - **UNCLEAR DIFFERENTIATION**
- **Concerning Signals**: Confusion with Scout AI (naming conflict), minimal public information
- **Evidence**: Limited traction signals, founder testimonial only
- **Risk Assessment**: Early-stage with limited validation
- **Mitigation Factors**: Dillon testimonial suggests some relationship, but weaker than Tier 1 companies

**Summary**: 2/14 companies (14%) with serious red flags. Both problematic companies are Tier 2 with NO GP involvement documentation, suggesting possible pattern of limited engagement with struggling investments.

### Companies Lacking Performance Data

- **Mesh Optical** (Tier 2, stealth): 3 FTEs, data center optics, minimal public information (legitimate stealth phase)
- **Biofire** (Tier 2): Smart firearm technology, Founders Fund lead (strong validation), limited public info
- **Marathon Fusion** (Tier 2): Recently added, fusion infrastructure, too early to assess

**Implication**: 3 companies (21%) in stealth or too early to assess. Standard for early-stage deeptech portfolio.

---

## GP Value-Add Assessment

*(See separate gp-relationships.md for full analysis)*

### Involvement Level: **HIGH** (for Tier 1) / **MODERATE** (for Tier 2)

**Evidence**: 9/14 companies (64%) have GP mentions
- Tier 1: 100% Dillon involvement (5/5 companies)
- Tier 2: 44% Dillon involvement (4/9 companies)
- Henry Bellew: 0% involvement (0/14 companies)

### Value-Add Demonstrated (Per Dataroom):

**Sourcing & Access**:
- Figure: Tamarack Global relationship enabled Series A allocation
- Quantinuum: Cold outreach → 6-year relationship
- Normal: Personal networking (NYC event)
- Dirac: VC referral → introduction to Founders Fund

**Strategic Support**:
- Normal: Hiring referrals (2 key hires), Series A fundraising assistance, financial modeling
- Dirac: GTM partner introductions, fundraising strategy (advised to pass early low-ball term sheet)
- Scout AI: GTM strategy, customer introductions, fundraising coaching

**Technical Depth**:
- Quantinuum: "Better technical understanding than major VCs" (founder testimonial)

- Relationship-driven (trusted confidante status)

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Henry Bellew Contribution**: Zero documented involvement raises efficiency questions
2. **Tier 2 Coverage**: 56% of Tier 2 companies lack GP involvement (includes 2 with red flags)
3. **External Validation**: ALL evidence from unverified dataroom sources

---

## Risk Assessment

### Portfolio-Level Risks

1. **Extreme Concentration Risk** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue**: Figure AI $3.76M current value likely represents >50% of portfolio value
   - **Impact**: If Figure fails to execute to $39B valuation, portfolio returns severely impacted
   - **Mitigation**: Quantinuum provides secondary winner (6.7x verified), but concentration remains high

2. **Mark-to-Market Risk** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Figure's $39B valuation on minimal revenue unsustainable if execution falters
   - **Impact**: Paper MOIC of 94x could compress rapidly if AI/robotics hype cycle ends
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain perspective that Figure valuation is paper, not realized

3. **Stage/Maturity Risk** (MODERATE)
   - **Issue**: 64% of portfolio Seed/Pre-Seed (high failure rate expected)
   - **Impact**: Majority of companies will likely fail or return <1x
   - **Mitigation**: Early-stage risk appropriate for VC; Tier 1/Tier 2 prioritization helps focus resources

4. **Verification Risk** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: 100% of GP value-add evidence from unverified dataroom sources
   - **Impact**: If key claims false (Dirac-FF intro, Normal advisor value), GP value proposition weakens
   - **Mitigation**: Urgent external validation required

5. **Dataroom Credibility Risk** (MODERATE-HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Natrion GM claim and Emerge acquisition claim both unverified/contradicted
   - **Impact**: Raises questions about accuracy of other dataroom representations
   - **Mitigation**: Assume dataroom marketing-optimized; verify all material claims

### Company-Specific High Risks

1. **Figure AI** (Tier 1): $39B valuation risk, pre-revenue, BMW pilot not production-scale, intense competition (Tesla Optimus)
2. **Natrion** (Tier 2): Investment thesis failure (GM claim false), credibility concern
3. **Emerge** (Tier 2): Unverified acquisition claims, zero public validation
4. **Scout vs Scout AI** (Both tiers): Naming conflict unresolved, confusion risk
5. **Marathon Fusion** (Tier 2): Fusion commercialization decades away, extreme technical risk

## Portfolio Quality Scoring

### 1. Company Quality Score: **7.5/10**

**Components**:
- **Team Quality: 8/10** - Strong technical founders (71% technical), serial entrepreneurs (Brett Adcock), domain experts (quantum/fusion PhDs)
- **Product/Technology: 8/10** - Cutting-edge deeptech (quantum, robotics, thermodynamic chips), AI-enabled breakthroughs
- **Traction: 6.5/10** - Figure/Quantinuum strong, but majority (64%) still pre-revenue Seed/Pre-Seed

**Justification**: High-quality technical founders and breakthrough technologies offset early-stage traction limitations. Two concerning outliers (Natrion, Emerge) reduce score.

### 2. Market Positioning Score: **8/10**

**Components**:
- **Market Opportunity: 9/10** - Massive TAMs (quantum $125B, humanoid robots $3T US, semiconductors $1T)
- **Competitive Position: 7.5/10** - Figure first-mover (BMW), Quantinuum market leader, but competition intense
- **Timing: 7.5/10** - AI breakthroughs enable portfolio (GPT-3.5 → humanoid robots), but hype cycle risk

**Justification**: Portfolio positioned at intersection of AI + deeptech megatrends. Quantinuum market leadership and Figure first-mover advantage strong signals. Timing excellent IF execution delivers.

### 3. Performance Trajectory Score: **7/10**

**Components**:
- **Growth Momentum: 8/10** - Figure 94x paper MOIC, Quantinuum 6.7x verified, Normal/Dirac strong Tier-1 VC validation
- **Operational Execution: 6.5/10** - Mixed signals; Figure BMW pilot vs. production gap, Normal F500 contracts positive
- **Capital Efficiency: 6.5/10** - Figure $2B raised (capital intensive), Quantinuum well-capitalized

**Justification**: Strong momentum in top performers, but early-stage nature of 64% portfolio means execution still unproven. Figure capital intensity appropriate for robotics but creates efficiency questions.

### 4. GP Value-Add Score: **6.5/10** (IF VERIFIED: 8/10)

**Components**:
- **Relationship Strength: 8/10** (per dataroom) - 100% Tier 1 involvement, strong testimonials
- **Demonstrated Support: 7/10** (per dataroom) - Hiring referrals, fundraising, GTM, VC intros
- **Strategic Guidance: 7/10** (per dataroom) - Technical depth, founder-first approach

**Current Score Reduced to 6.5/10 Due To**:
- **Verification Gap**: ALL evidence unverified (−1 point)
- **Henry Absence**: Zero involvement across 14 companies (−0.5 points)
- **Tier 2 Coverage Gap**: 56% Tier 2 lack involvement (−1 point)

**Justification**: IF dataroom claims verify (Dirac-FF intro, Normal advisor value, Figure Tamarack relationship), score = 8/10. Current score penalized for lack of external validation.

### 5. Risk-Adjusted Potential Score: **7/10**

**Components**:
- **Upside Potential: 9/10** - Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x, portfolio positioned for outlier outcomes
- **Risk Factors: 5/10** (inverse) - Extreme concentration, mark-to-market, verification gaps, 2 red-flag companies
- **Portfolio Balance: 6/10** - Concentration in Figure creates imbalance, but Quantinuum provides hedge

**Justification**: Exceptional upside (Figure/Quantinuum) balanced by significant risks (concentration, valuation, verification). Portfolio could return top-decile OR face severe compression.

---

## Overall Portfolio Quality Score: **7.5/10**

**Overall Assessment**: **Above Average / Strong** (with significant caveats)

**Detailed Justification**:

**Strengths (Positive Factors)**:
1. **Outlier Outcomes**: Figure AI (94x) + Quantinuum (6.7x) = exceptional performers IF valuations hold
2. **Technical Thesis**: Coherent deeptech/AI strategy with breakthrough technology focus
3. **Co-Investor Validation**: Founders Fund, Coatue, Microsoft, NVIDIA backing validates investment quality
4. **GP Involvement** (per dataroom): 100% Tier 1 coverage suggests active value-add
5. **Market Timing**: Portfolio positioned at AI + deeptech convergence (structural tailwinds)

**Weaknesses (Negative Factors)**:
1. **Concentration Risk**: 1-2 companies drive majority of portfolio value (Figure dominance)
2. **Valuation Risk**: Figure $39B on minimal revenue unsustainable if execution falters
3. **Verification Gap**: ALL GP value-add unverified; dataroom credibility concerns (Natrion, Emerge)
4. **Henry Absence**: Zero involvement raises GP team utilization questions
5. **Early-Stage Risk**: 64% Seed/Pre-Seed (high expected failure rate)

**Comparison to Typical VC Portfolios**:
- **Above average** technical founder quality (71% technical vs. typical 40-50%)
- **Above average** co-investor quality (Founders Fund, Coatue vs. typical regional VCs)
- **Above average** paper returns IF Figure/Quantinuum hold (94x + 6.7x vs. typical 1-2 winners per fund)
- **Higher risk** due to extreme concentration (Figure = >50% value vs. typical 20-30% in top company)
- **Standard** for stage distribution (64% Seed/Pre-Seed typical for emerging manager)

**Conditional Assessment**:
- **IF Figure executes to valuation + dataroom claims verify**: Score = **9/10** (Exceptional)
- **IF Figure valuation compresses 50% + dataroom claims false**: Score = **5.5/10** (Below Average)
- **Current score (7.5/10)** assumes middle scenario: Figure partially delivers, some dataroom claims verify

---

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Portfolio Driven by Exceptional Outlier (Figure AI 94x)**
   - Evidence: $40K → $3.76M paper value, $39.5B valuation
   - Implication: Portfolio returns highly dependent on single company execution
   - Action: Monitor Figure BMW deployment progress, revenue trajectory, competitive position (Tesla Optimus)

2. **Deeptech Thesis Coherence is Portfolio Strength**
   - Evidence: 11 distinct sectors, but thematic focus on AI + hard science convergence
   - Implication: Portfolio benefits from megatrend tailwinds (AI breakthroughs + labor shortages + infrastructure buildout)
   - Action: Continue deeptech focus, monitor AI hype cycle for valuation risk

3. **Tier-1 Co-Investor Validation Strongly Positive**
   - Evidence: Founders Fund (Dirac), Coatue (Dirac), Microsoft/NVIDIA/Bezos (Figure), IBM/JPMorgan (Quantinuum)
   - Implication: Independent validation of investment quality by sophisticated investors
   - Action: Leverage co-investor relationships for due diligence (verify GP claims with Trae Stephens at FF)

4. **GP Value-Add Claims Require Urgent Verification**
   - Evidence: 100% dataroom-only sources, 0% external validation, concerning red flags (Natrion, Emerge)
   - Implication: Cannot assess GP value-add without independent confirmation
   - Action: Interview Fil Aronshtein (Dirac), Faris Sbahi (Normal), Trae Stephens (FF) outside fundraising context

5. **Henry Bellew Absence Raises Efficiency Concern**
   - Evidence: Zero mentions across 14 companies (including 5 with 94x-6.7x MOICs)
   - Implication: GP team utilization questions, possible value concentration in Dillon only
   - Action: Clarify division of labor, assess Henry's actual contribution to fund

6. **Investment Thesis Failures (Natrion, Emerge) Create Credibility Concern**
   - Evidence: GM "customer" claim false (Natrion is investor), Apple/Meta "acquisition" claim unverified (Emerge)
   - Implication: Dataroom may contain marketing-optimized or false representations
   - Action: Verify ALL material claims, assume dataroom is marketing document

7. **Portfolio Positioned for Top-Decile or Significant Compression**
   - Evidence: Figure 94x + Quantinuum 6.7x IF holds, OR Figure compression + early-stage failures = poor returns
   - Implication: Binary outcome distribution (great OR mediocre, low probability of average)
   - Action: Assess risk tolerance for concentrated, binary outcome portfolio

## Opportunities

**High-Priority Opportunities**:

1. **Figure AI Upside Capture** (Portfolio #1 priority)
   - **Opportunity**: If Figure executes to $39B+ valuation, Hyperion returns top-decile VC
   - **Catalyst**: BMW production deployment, second F500 customer announced, robotics demand acceleration
   - **Action**: Monitor quarterly progress, maintain position, assess follow-on opportunities

2. **Normal Computing Series B** (Tier 1 emerging winner)
   - **Opportunity**: "Preempt interest from several top VCs" suggests strong Series B pricing
   - **Catalyst**: F500 semiconductor customer contracts (Q1 2025), thermodynamic chip validation
   - **Action**: Secure pro-rata or expansion allocation if Dillon has advisor rights

3. **Dirac Follow-On** (Tier 1 strong seed)
   - **Opportunity**: Founders Fund + Coatue backing, defense/aerospace pilots (Anduril, Lockheed)
   - **Catalyst**: Production contracts from pilot programs, Series A raise
   - **Action**: Maintain relationship, assess follow-on opportunity

4. **Quantinuum Liquidity** (Verified winner)
   - **Opportunity**: $8.8B valuation, potential IPO or acquisition by strategic (Honeywell, IBM, etc.)
   - **Catalyst**: Quantum algorithm breakthroughs, F500 customer expansion
   - **Action**: Monitor secondary market, assess partial liquidity opportunities

## Areas for Further Investigation

**Requires Deeper Diligence**:

1. **Figure AI Valuation Justification** (CRITICAL)
   - **Reason**: $39B on minimal revenue requires extraordinary growth assumptions
   - **Questions**:
     - What revenue projections justify $39B?
     - BMW contract terms (pilot vs. production)?
     - Unit economics at scale (can achieve <$20K unit cost)?
     - Competitive response from Tesla Optimus?
   - **Action**: Request Figure financial model, customer pipeline, production roadmap

2. **Natrion & Emerge Dataroom Discrepancies** (CRITICAL)
   - **Reason**: False/unverified claims raise dataroom credibility concerns
   - **Questions**:
     - How did GM "customer" claim get into dataroom (Natrion)?
     - Any evidence of Apple/Meta acquisition conversations (Emerge)?
     - Other dataroom representations that may be false?
   - **Action**: Full dataroom review with skeptical lens, verify all material claims

3. **Henry Bellew Role & Contribution** (HIGH)
   - **Reason**: Zero involvement across 14 companies unusual for GP
   - **Questions**:
     - What is Henry's actual role in fund?
     - Division of labor with Dillon?
     - Any non-portfolio contributions (operations, fundraising, LP relations)?
   - **Action**: Interview Dillon & Henry, assess GP team utilization

4. **Scout vs. Scout AI Naming Conflict** (MODERATE)
   - **Reason**: Two companies with identical/similar names creates confusion
   - **Questions**:
     - Are these the same company or different entities?
     - If different, how to avoid confusion in communications?
     - If same, why listed separately in Tier 1 and Tier 2?
   - **Action**: Clarify naming, recommend one company rebrand if different entities

5. **Dirac-Founders Fund Introduction Verification** (HIGH)
   - **Reason**: IF Dillon intro was causal, strong value-add signal. IF not, dataroom overstates impact.
   - **Questions**:
     - Did Dillon introduce Fil to Trae Stephens?
     - Was introduction critical or one of many sourcing paths?
     - Trae's perspective on Dillon's value-add?
   - **Action**: Contact Trae Stephens directly or via backchannel

## Recommendations

Based on this assessment:

### 1. Priority Companies for Detailed Investment Memos

**Figure AI** (Tier 1, Portfolio Champion):
- **Rationale**: 94x MOIC drives portfolio returns; requires deep understanding of valuation assumptions and execution risks
- **Memo Focus**: Revenue model validation, BMW contract terms, unit economics, competitive analysis (Tesla Optimus)

**Quantinuum** (Tier 1, Verified Winner):
- **Rationale**: 6.7x verified MOIC, market leader, potential liquidity event
- **Memo Focus**: Quantum commercialization timeline, customer traction, IPO/M&A potential

**Normal Computing** (Tier 1, Emerging Winner):
- **Rationale**: Preparing Series B, F500 contracts, advisor relationship with Dillon
- **Memo Focus**: Thermodynamic chip validation, Series B pricing/terms, follow-on opportunity

### 2. Companies Requiring Monitoring

**Natrion** (Tier 2, Red Flag):
- **Concern**: GM claim false/misleading, investment thesis failure
- **Action**: Verify actual GM relationship, assess write-down potential

**Emerge** (Tier 2, Red Flag):
- **Concern**: Unverified acquisition claims, zero public validation
- **Action**: Verify Apple/Meta conversations, assess credibility

**Figure AI** (Tier 1, Valuation Risk):
- **Concern**: $39B valuation on minimal revenue unsustainable if execution falters
- **Action**: Quarterly progress check (BMW progress, revenue, customers, Optimus competition)

### 3. Portfolio-Level Actions

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Verify GP Value-Add Claims** (URGENT): Interview Fil (Dirac), Faris (Normal), Trae Stephens (FF), Ilyas Khan (Quantinuum) outside fundraising context
2. **Clarify Henry Bellew Role** (HIGH): Assess GP team utilization, division of labor
3. **Dataroom Accuracy Review** (HIGH): Verify all material claims with skeptical lens after Natrion/Emerge discrepancies
4. **Scout Naming Conflict Resolution** (MODERATE): Clarify if same company or different entities

**Strategic Considerations**:
1. **Concentration Risk Management**: Figure dominance creates portfolio fragility; diversify within portfolio or accept binary outcome
2. **Follow-On Strategy**: Assess pro-rata/expansion opportunities in Normal (Series B), Dirac (Series A), others
3. **External Validation Protocol**: Establish process for verifying dataroom claims before accepting at face value
4. **GP Value Transparency**: Request evidence of GP involvement beyond testimonials (intros verification, advisory board minutes, etc.)

### 4. Further Research Needed

**Deep Dives Required**:
- Figure AI valuation model and revenue projections
- Natrion/Emerge dataroom claim investigation
- Henry Bellew contribution assessment
- Dirac-Founders Fund introduction verification
- Scout vs. Scout AI naming clarification
