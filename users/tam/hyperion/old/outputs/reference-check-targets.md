## Red Flags / Notes

### Relationship Strength Claims
- **Vague language alert**: Multiple claims of "close relationships" and "trusted relationships" without quantifiable metrics. Key validation needed on:
  - Tamarack Global: How frequently do they share deal flow? Would they commit to ongoing collaboration?
  - Coatue: What does "close" mean in practice? Co-investment track record beyond Dirac?
  - Amazon: Who specifically at AWS/warehouses? Have these contacts resulted in actual customer contracts for portfolio?

### Vista Colleagues LP Commitment
- **Verify specifics**: Letter claims "senior Vista leaders" are providing "LP commitments and references" but doesn't name individuals or specify amounts. Key questions:
  - Which specific Vista partners/MDs are investing?
  - How much capital are they committing?
  - Are these truly "senior leaders" or peers/junior colleagues?

### Figure AI Board Member Mentor
- **Anonymous claim**: No name provided for "Figure AI board member" mentor. This should be verifiable:
  - Who is this person? (Figure board includes Brett Adcock, investors from strategic round)
  - What's the actual collaboration commitment on spin-outs?
  - Is this a formal arrangement or informal relationship?

### Sourcing Network Tier System
- **Self-defined tiers**: The "Tier 1-4" classification of generalist VCs is Hyperion's own framework, not industry-standard. Questions:
  - Do these VCs actually view Hyperion as a "filter for too-early deals"?
  - Is there reciprocal deal flow or just Dillon reaching out?
  - Difference between "collaborator" vs. network contact?

### Harvard Founder Relationships
- **Age-based friendships**: Multiple Harvard connections described as "friendships" with founders from classes '19-'28. While valuable for sourcing, depth of relationships unclear:
  - Are these active working relationships or loose social connections?
  - Have any Harvard founders actually taken Dillon's investment or advisory?

### Failed Investment Learnings
- Bleximo and Entheos failures demonstrate judgment risks:
  - Bleximo: Invested after only 2 phone calls, insufficient founder diligence, over-indexed on Khosla/GV interest
  - Entheos: Missed supply chain concentration risk, didn't reference key vendor (TESVOLT)
- **Positive**: Dillon transparently documents lessons learned. **Question**: Has he internalized these lessons? Would references confirm improved diligence discipline?

### Performance Verification
- Track record shows 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR, but heavy concentration in 2-3 winners (Quantinuum, Figure AI)
- Of 16 investments held >15 months: 12 marked up, 2 flat, 2 shut down (75% markup rate)
- **Key validation**: Are the valuations (especially Quantinuum secondary at $10.6B, Figure at $39.5B) real and recently transacted?

### Co-Investment Dynamics
- Strong co-investor quality (Founders Fund, Coatue, DCVC, Thrive) but unclear if Dillon is driving deals or following others' leads
- **Question for references**: Does Dillon bring unique sourcing/diligence value, or is he primarily accessing deals through relationships and adding value post-investment?
