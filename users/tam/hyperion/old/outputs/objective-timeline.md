## Timeline Notes

**Coverage Period**: 2015 (Dillon enters Harvard) to September 2025 (latest portfolio valuations)

**Source Distribution**:
- Tier 1 (Entity-controlled): 22 events (dataroom materials, GP bio, LP letter, Substack)
- Tier 2 (Affiliated): 2 events (LinkedIn verification, research summary compiled from multiple sources)
- Tier 3 (Independent): 10 events (public funding announcements, company mergers, third-party news)

**Potential Gaps**:

1. **Fusion Energy Investments**: Dataroom claims Dillon "met nearly 20 fusion startups, investing in 3 reactor players (Zap Energy, Avalanche Energy, Hephaestus) and 1 infrastructure player (Marathon Fusion)" but NO events extracted for these investments. Need dates for:
   - When Dillon met Zap Energy CEO (claimed "maintained relationship from 2021 onward")
   - When Zap Energy Series D investment (~$140K) occurred
   - When Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon investments occurred
   - When Zap Energy became "consensus" (to validate "early" claim)

2. **Firmament Exits**: Dataroom mentions "helped execute" Envase (>5x MOIC, sold $230M Jan-23) and Logistyx (>3x MOIC, sold $185M Mar-22), but these exits occurred AFTER Dillon left Firmament (Jan 2021). Need events for:
   - When Firmament acquired Envase and Logistyx (Dillon's involvement period)
   - Dillon's specific role vs. institutional team effort

3. **Vista Deployments**: Claim of "deployed >$1 billion across 15+ deals" at Vista lacks events. Need:
   - Specific Vista deals Dillon worked on (Databricks, Fivetran, Acronis mentioned in GP Bio)
   - Dates of Vista investments
   - Dillon's actual role vs. team/institutional credit

4. **Thought Leadership Timing**: Claim "built vertical SaaS thesis early, before investing" style claims need validation:
   - Was Substack quantum article published BEFORE or AFTER March 2020 Quantinuum investment?
   - Was fusion article (April 2022) published BEFORE or AFTER Zap Energy investment?
   - Exact dates of Substack articles needed for timing analysis

5. **Other Personal Investments**: Dataroom mentions 24 total startups in portfolio, 6 KEY claims companies documented, but 18 other investments have NO timeline events

6. **Henry Bellew Events**: No events extracted for Henry Bellew (co-GP), only presence in research-summary.md noting Harvard 2023 graduation and Raine Group role

**Events Not Found in Research (Claimed in Dataroom)**:
- Dillon "spearheaded AI research and strategy" at Vista 2023-2025 (no dates or specifics)
- "From 2022 to 2025, Dillon met nearly 20 fusion startups" (no event dates for meetings or investments)
- "Fusion energy CEOs cite his deep-dive blog post on market and reactor architectures" (need timing: blog post vs. investments)
- Multiple "portfolio founders refer 40% of deal flow" claims (no events showing referral flow)
- "50+ passive deeptech founder referrals per year" ramping to "300+ per year" (no events demonstrating referral volume)

**Critical Omissions (Per Methodology)**:

1. **Failed Investments**: LP Letter mentions "3 of the next 4 investments that I sourced and led in 2020 and 2021 were underperformers" and "one company in particular fire-sold for pennies on the dollar" — NO events or company names for these failures in timeline

2. **Quiet Periods**: Timeline shows active angel investing starting mid-2022, but period between Quantinuum (March 2020) and Figure AI (April 2023) has minimal events beyond Vista employment and Substack articles

3. **Thought Leadership AFTER Action**: Need to verify if blog posts followed or preceded investments to check for retroactive narrative construction

**Consensus Timing Benchmarks** (for "early investor" validation):

- **Figure AI consensus**: Series B (Feb 2024) at $2.6B with Bezos, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI = institutional tier-1 backing. Dillon's Series A entry (April 2023) was 10 months before Series B. Gap: 10 months = ✅ Pre-consensus (>90 days)

- **Quantinuum consensus**: Unclear. March 2020 investment in CQC predated November 2021 Quantinuum merger and February 2024 $5.3B round, but when did institutional tier-1 VCs join? Timeline shows Honeywell merger (Nov 2021) as potential consensus event, making March 2020 investment 20 months pre-consensus = ✅ Pre-consensus

- **Dirac consensus**: Founders Fund + Coatue seed co-lead (April 2024) = consensus. Dillon's pre-seed (Nov 2023) was 5 months before. Gap: 5 months = ✅ Pre-consensus (>90 days)

- **Normal Computing consensus**: Unclear if Series A (April 2024) or seed counts as consensus. If Series A, then Dillon's relationship building (May 2023-Q1 2024) was pre-consensus but investment timing unclear.

## Source Verification Status

**High Confidence (Multiple Independent Sources)**:
- Dillon's Harvard degree and Vista/Firmament employment (LinkedIn, research-summary.md)
- Quantinuum merger, funding rounds, valuations (press releases, public announcements)
- Figure AI funding rounds, valuations (press releases, TechCrunch, multiple outlets)
- Dillon's Substack existence and article dates (direct verification of Substack archive)

**Medium Confidence (Credible but Limited Sources)**:
- Quantinuum investment details (dataroom case study + founder testimonial, but no independent press)
- Figure AI investment via Tamarack relationship (dataroom + Tamarack participation verified)
- Normal/Dirac relationship details (dataroom case studies + founder testimonials, but no public mentions)
- Funding amount discrepancies between dataroom and public announcements

**Low Confidence (Dataroom Only, Unverified)**:
- Specific value-add activities (hiring referrals, financial modeling, VC introductions)
- "120+ quantum founder outreach" claim (no independent verification)
- "Met nearly 20 fusion startups" claim (no independent verification)
- Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin pilot claims for Dirac (no public verification, contradicted by absence)
- Advisory equity awards and amounts (private agreements, not disclosed)
- Specific role in Firmament exits (exits occurred after Dillon departed)

## Key Patterns for Phase 3 Validation

1. **Timing Pattern**: Most portfolio company investments (Figure, Dirac, Normal) occurred in 2023, shortly before or concurrent with major funding rounds in 2024, enabling "early investor" narrative. Need to assess if timing was genuinely prescient vs. opportunistic.

2. **Founder Testimonial Pattern**: All major case studies (Quantinuum, Figure, Normal, Dirac) include founder testimonials in dataroom materials, but ZERO public mentions of Dillon found in research. This suggests testimonials were solicited for fundraising rather than unprompted endorsements.

3. **Sourcing Attribution Pattern**: Claims of personal sourcing (cold outreach, networking events, VC referrals) are all from Tier 1 sources (dataroom). No independent verification of how deals were sourced.

4. **Performance Claims**: 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR claims rely entirely on company valuations which are:
   - Latest rounds (often overvalued in bull market)
   - Self-reported marks (no independent audit)
   - May include aspirational valuations (e.g., Figure AI $39B for pre-revenue company)

5. **Thought Leadership Timing**: Substack articles published 2021-2022 demonstrate sustained intellectual engagement, but EXACT timing relative to investments needed to verify if thought leadership preceded or followed action.

---

**Phase 3 Next Steps**:
1. Cross-reference each claim in claims-inventory.md against this timeline
2. Apply verification categories (✅⚠️❓❌🕐) based on source tiers and timing analysis
3. Identify critical omissions (failed investments, timeline gaps, conflicts)
4. Assess retroactive framing (did thought leadership precede or follow investments?)
5. Evaluate "early investor" claims using 90-day consensus benchmark
