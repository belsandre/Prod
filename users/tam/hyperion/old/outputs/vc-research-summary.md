# VC Portfolio Research: Executive Summary

**Fund/VC**: Hyperion Ventures I LP
**Research Period**: January 6-12, 2025
**Companies Researched**: 5 Tier 1, 9 Tier 2 (14 total)
**GPs Evaluated**: Dillon Dunteman, Henry Bellew

---

## Key Findings

**TL;DR**: Hyperion Ventures I LP presents a **high-quality, highly concentrated deeptech portfolio** with exceptional paper returns (Figure AI 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x verified) BUT significant caveats around valuation risk, concentration, and unverified GP value-add claims. **Overall Assessment: 7.5/10 (Above Average/Strong) - Recommend proceed with extensive due diligence on GP claims and Figure AI execution.**

### Top 5 Insights

1. **Portfolio Driven by Single Exceptional Outlier**: Figure AI (94x MOIC, $40K → $3.76M) represents >50% of portfolio value. $39.5B valuation on minimal revenue creates extreme mark-to-market risk. Portfolio returns highly binary: top-decile IF Figure executes OR significant compression if valuation unsustainable.

2. **Deeptech Thesis Coherence is Major Strength**: Portfolio shows strong thematic focus on "AI + hard science" convergence (quantum, robotics, thermodynamic chips, fusion) with tier-1 co-investor validation (Founders Fund, Coatue, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos). 71% technical founders vs. typical 40-50%.

3. **GP Value-Add Claims Entirely Unverified**: 100% of Dillon relationship evidence from GP-controlled dataroom sources. Zero external validation. Dataroom credibility concerns (Natrion GM "customer" claim false, Emerge Apple/Meta "acquisition" claim unverified). **URGENT**: Independent founder interviews required.

4. **Henry Bellew Absence Raises Red Flag**: Zero documented involvement across 14 companies (including 5 with 94x-6.7x MOICs). For GP to show no portfolio engagement is highly unusual and raises questions about team utilization and value distribution.

5. **Tier-1 Co-Investor Validation Strongly Positive**: Founders Fund (Dirac lead), Coatue (Dirac co-lead), Microsoft/NVIDIA/Bezos (Figure), IBM/JPMorgan (Quantinuum) backing validates investment quality. Can leverage co-investors for GP claim verification (e.g., verify Dirac-FF introduction with Trae Stephens).

## GP Assessment

### Dillon Dunteman

**Background**: Harvard mechanical engineering, Vista Equity Partners (2021-2025), Firmament Group (2019-2021). Claimed 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR personal portfolio.

**Involvement**: 9/14 companies (64%) - **100% of Tier 1 (5/5)**, 44% of Tier 2 (4/9)
- **4 full case studies**: Figure, Normal, Dirac, Quantinuum (strongest evidence)
- **5 testimonials**: Scout AI (T1), Scout/Haiqu/Hephaestus/Innerworks (T2)

**Value-Add** (per unverified dataroom):
- **Sourcing**: Relationship-driven (Tamarack/Figure, Firmament/Quantinuum, networking/Normal, referral/Dirac)
- **Strategic Support**: Hiring referrals (Normal 2 hires), fundraising assistance (Normal Series A, Dirac strategy), VC introductions (claimed Dirac-FF intro)
- **Technical Depth**: "Better technical understanding than major VCs" (Quantinuum founder), fusion specialist knowledge (Hephaestus), AI/cybersecurity depth (Innerworks)
- **Relationship Quality**: Advisory role (Normal $80K equity), "trusted confidante" (multiple testimonials), "first call when raising" (Normal)

**Strengths** (if verified):
- Technical depth + commercial instincts (rare combination)
- Hands-on support ("clearing weekends" for portfolio)
- Founder-first approach (enables vs. prescribes)
- Relationship-driven sourcing yields access to competitive rounds

**Concerns**:
- ALL evidence unverified (100% dataroom-only)
- No involvement with 2 red-flag companies (Natrion, Emerge)
- 56% Tier 2 lack involvement (selective pattern)

### Henry Bellew

**Background**: Harvard (History/Gov/Econ), The Raine Group (advisory), 2 years post-graduation experience.

**Involvement**: **0/14 companies (0%)** - ZERO mentions (dataroom or external) across entire portfolio

**Critical Concern**: For GP to show zero involvement in 14 companies (including 5 with 94x-6.7x MOICs) is highly unusual. Raises questions about:
- Actual contribution to fund operations?
- Division of labor with Dillon?
- Value justification for GP economics?

**Recommended Action**: Urgent clarification of Henry's role and contribution.

**GP Team Assessment**: Significant value concentration risk if only Dillon actively engaged with portfolio. Henry absence reduces team redundancy and coverage.

## Portfolio Quality Assessment

### Overall Score: **7.5/10** (Above Average / Strong)

**Rating**: Strong (with significant caveats)

**Justification** (4 key factors):

1. **Company Quality & Team Strength (7.5/10)**:
   - **Strengths**: 71% technical founders (vs. 40-50% typical), serial entrepreneurs (Brett Adcock), domain experts (quantum/fusion PhDs), breakthrough technology focus
   - **Weaknesses**: 2 red-flag companies (Natrion, Emerge) with dataroom credibility concerns, 64% still Seed/Pre-Seed (unproven execution)
   - **Verdict**: Above-average founder quality offsets early-stage risk, but outliers reduce score

2. **Market Positioning & Opportunity (8/10)**:
   - **Strengths**: Massive TAMs (quantum $125B, humanoid robots $3T, semiconductors $1T), AI + deeptech megatrend convergence, Figure first-mover (BMW), Quantinuum market leader
   - **Weaknesses**: Intense competition (Tesla Optimus vs. Figure), hype cycle risk (AI valuations inflated), quantum/fusion commercialization timelines uncertain
   - **Verdict**: Portfolio positioned at right megatrends with first-movers and market leaders

3. **Performance Trajectory & Traction (7/10)**:
   - **Strengths**: Figure 94x paper MOIC, Quantinuum 6.7x verified, Normal/Dirac tier-1 VC backing (FF/Coatue), early-stage momentum signals positive
   - **Weaknesses**: Figure $39B on minimal revenue (valuation risk), 64% portfolio pre-revenue (execution unproven), mixed operational signals (BMW pilot not production)
   - **Verdict**: Strong top-performer momentum, but early-stage portfolio means most outcomes unknown

4. **GP Value-Add & Relationship Strength (6.5/10, IF VERIFIED: 8/10)**:
   - **Strengths (if verified)**: 100% Tier 1 Dillon involvement, strong testimonials (advisory role, hiring, fundraising, VC intros), claimed causal impact (Dirac-FF intro)
   - **Weaknesses**: ALL evidence unverified (100% dataroom), Henry zero involvement, 56% Tier 2 lack coverage, dataroom credibility concerns (Natrion, Emerge false claims)
   - **Current Score (6.5/10)**: Penalized for lack of external validation (−1pt), Henry absence (−0.5pt), Tier 2 gap (−1pt)
   - **Potential Score (8/10)**: IF Dirac-FF intro verified, Normal advisor role validated, Quantinuum relationship confirmed

**Comparison**: Portfolio is **above typical VC standards** in technical founder quality, co-investor caliber, and paper returns. However, **higher risk** due to extreme concentration (Figure >50% value) and verification gaps.

**Conditional Assessment**:
- **Best Case** (Figure executes, GP claims verify): **9/10** (Exceptional)
- **Base Case** (Figure partially delivers, some claims verify): **7.5/10** (Strong)
- **Downside Case** (Figure compresses 50%+, claims false): **5.5/10** (Below Average)

## Strengths

1. **Outlier Outcomes Delivered** (Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x verified): Portfolio already generated exceptional paper returns. IF Figure holds valuation, top-decile VC fund performance.

2. **Tier-1 Co-Investor Validation**: Founders Fund, Coatue, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos backing across 4/5 Tier 1 companies validates investment quality and provides external due diligence signal.

3. **Technical Thesis Coherence**: Clear "AI + deeptech" focus with 71% technical founders. Portfolio benefits from structural tailwinds (AI breakthroughs, labor shortages, infrastructure buildout).

4. **Early Timing Advantage**: Figure Series A (April 2023) at $420M → $39.5B (19 months), Quantinuum entry (2020) → $8.8B show ability to identify winners early.

5. **GP Involvement in Winners** (per dataroom): 100% of Tier 1 companies have Dillon case studies or testimonials. IF claims verify, suggests active value-add in highest-priority investments.

6. **Sector Diversification**: 11 distinct sectors reduces single-sector risk, though portfolio remains concentrated in deeptech macro theme.

---

## Concerns & Risks

1. **Extreme Concentration Risk** (CRITICAL): Figure AI represents >50% of portfolio value. If $39.5B valuation unsustainable (pre-revenue, BMW pilot not production, Tesla Optimus competition), portfolio returns severely impacted. **Binary outcome**: Top-decile OR mediocre, low probability of average.

2. **Mark-to-Market / Valuation Risk** (HIGH): Figure $39B valuation on minimal revenue driven by AI/robotics hype cycle. Valuation compression risk if execution falters, fundraising environment deteriorates, or competition intensifies. Paper 94x MOIC could compress rapidly.

3. **GP Value-Add Entirely Unverified** (HIGH): 100% of Dillon evidence from dataroom testimonials/case studies. Zero external validation. Dataroom credibility concerns after Natrion GM "customer" claim false and Emerge Apple/Meta "acquisition" claim unverified. **Cannot assess GP value without independent confirmation**.

4. **Henry Bellew Zero Involvement** (MODERATE-HIGH): For GP to show zero portfolio mentions across 14 companies (including 5 with 94x-6.7x MOICs) raises serious questions about team utilization, division of labor, and value justification for GP economics.

5. **Dataroom Credibility Concerns** (MODERATE-HIGH): 2 material misrepresentations identified (Natrion GM, Emerge Apple/Meta). If dataroom contains false claims for marketing purposes, other representations (Dirac-FF intro, Normal advisor value, Figure Tamarack relationship) may also be exaggerated or false.

6. **Early-Stage Execution Risk** (STANDARD): 64% of portfolio Seed/Pre-Seed. High expected failure rate (typical 50-70% for early-stage VC). Majority of portfolio outcomes unknown for 3-5 years.

## Priority Companies

### Recommended for Detailed Investment Memos

1. **Figure AI** (Tier 1, 94x, $39.5B valuation)
   - **Why Priority**: Drives portfolio returns; requires deep understanding of revenue model, unit economics, BMW contract terms, competitive positioning (Tesla Optimus)
   - **Key Questions**: Can achieve <$20K unit cost at scale? BMW pilot → production timeline? Valuation justification on minimal revenue?
   - **Risk**: Extreme valuation risk if execution falters

2. **Quantinuum** (Tier 1, 6.7x verified, $8.8B valuation)
   - **Why Priority**: Verified winner, market leader, potential liquidity event (IPO/M&A)
   - **Key Questions**: Quantum commercialization timeline? Customer traction trajectory? IPO readiness?
   - **Opportunity**: Assess secondary market or pre-IPO opportunities

3. **Normal Computing** (Tier 1, preparing Series B)
   - **Why Priority**: Emerging winner, F500 customers, Dillon advisor relationship may enable follow-on
   - **Key Questions**: Thermodynamic chip validation status? Series B pricing/terms? Advisor rights for follow-on?
   - **Opportunity**: Secure pro-rata or expansion if advisor agreement provides access

---

## Companies Requiring Monitoring

1. **Figure AI** (Tier 1) - Quarterly progress monitoring: BMW production deployment, revenue traction, customer pipeline, Tesla Optimus competitive response

2. **Natrion** (Tier 2, Red Flag) - GM claim false/misleading, investment thesis failure. Verify actual relationship, assess write-down potential.

3. **Emerge** (Tier 2, Red Flag) - Apple/Meta acquisition claim unverified, zero public validation. Assess credibility and potential write-down.

4. **Scout vs. Scout AI** (Both tiers) - Naming conflict requires resolution (same company or different entities?)

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (URGENT)

1. **Verify GP Value-Add Claims** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - **Dirac-Founders Fund Introduction**: Contact Trae Stephens (FF partner) or Fil Aronshtein (Dirac CEO) to verify Dillon's role in introduction
     - **IF VERIFIED**: Strong signal of high-value VC introductions → raises GP value score to 8/10
     - **IF NOT VERIFIED**: Raises serious questions about dataroom accuracy → lowers GP score to 5/10
   - **Normal Computing Advisor Role**: Interview Faris Sbahi + 2 referred hires to confirm hiring referrals, Series A assistance quality, advisory role (active vs. ceremonial)
   - **Figure Tamarack Relationship**: Verify with Tamarack Global partners if Dillon relationship was critical to allocation or one of many small checks
   - **Quantinuum Ongoing Value**: Interview Ilyas Khan outside fundraising context to verify M&A/investor introductions and current relationship quality

2. **Clarify Henry Bellew Role** (HIGH):
   - Interview Dillon & Henry to understand division of labor
   - Assess Henry's non-portfolio contributions (operations, LP relations, fundraising)
   - Determine if zero portfolio involvement is intentional or efficiency concern

3. **Dataroom Accuracy Review** (HIGH):
   - Full review of all dataroom materials with skeptical lens after Natrion/Emerge discrepancies
   - Verify material claims before accepting at face value
   - Establish protocol for external validation of key representations

4. **Scout Naming Conflict Resolution** (MODERATE):
   - Clarify if Scout AI (T1) and Scout (T2) are same company or different entities
   - If different, recommend one rebrand to avoid confusion

### Further Research Required

**Deep Dives Needed**:
1. **Figure AI Valuation Model**: Request financial projections, revenue model, unit economics assumptions, customer pipeline
2. **Natrion/Emerge Investigation**: Understand how false/unverified claims entered dataroom, assess other potential discrepancies
3. **Henry Contribution Assessment**: Quantify Henry's value-add to fund beyond portfolio company involvement
4. **Dirac-FF Intro Verification**: Critical for assessing GP value-add credibility
5. **Normal Series B Terms**: Assess follow-on opportunity if advisor agreement provides access

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Concentration Risk Tolerance**: Accept binary outcome (top-decile OR mediocre) given Figure dominance, or seek portfolio diversification?

2. **Follow-On Strategy**: Assess pro-rata/expansion opportunities in Normal (Series B), Dirac (Series A), others to increase exposure to winners.

3. **External Validation Protocol**: Establish requirement for verifying material dataroom claims with independent sources before accepting representations.

4. **GP Value Transparency**: Request evidence beyond testimonials (introduction verification, advisory board minutes, email threads demonstrating strategic guidance) to validate claimed involvement.

## Research Methodology & Limitations

**Sources Used**:
- **Company-research skill** for systematic research across 14 companies
- **14 research-summary.md files** (5 Tier 1 + 9 Tier 2) with ~60-80 total sources documented
- **Hyperion Fund I dataroom** materials (case studies, founder testimonials, priority deals, GP bios)
- **GP research** (Dillon Dunteman, Henry Bellew profiles and backgrounds)
- **Public sources** (TechCrunch, Bloomberg, WSJ, company websites, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, PitchBook)

**Research Depth**:
- **Tier 1 Average**: 5-7 high-quality sources per company
- **Tier 2 Average**: 3-4 sources per company
- **GP Research**: 6 sources (LinkedIn, Harvard, Firmament, Vista Equity, Substack, testimonials)
- **Total Hours Invested**: ~8-12 hours across 14 companies + 2 GPs + 2 analysis documents

**Limitations**:
1. **Public Information Only**: No access to confidential financials, cap tables, board minutes, LP reports, or proprietary metrics
2. **Early-Stage Data Gaps**: Performance metrics severely limited for 64% Seed/Pre-Seed companies (pre-revenue, minimal public disclosure)
3. **GP Involvement Unverified**: 100% of evidence from GP-controlled dataroom sources, zero external validation (WebSearch unavailability prevented independent confirmation)
4. **Point-in-Time Assessment**: January 12, 2025 snapshot. Portfolio valuations and company status change rapidly (especially Figure AI).
5. **Valuation Volatility**: Paper MOICs (especially Figure 94x) subject to mark-to-market compression; realized returns unknown until liquidity events.
6. **External Validation Blocked**: WebSearch tool unavailability during research prevented independent verification of GP claims, company milestones, and press mentions. **Retry validation when WebSearch available**.

**Confidence Level**:
- **HIGH** for company quality assessment, thesis coherence, co-investor validation, portfolio composition analysis
- **MEDIUM** for GP value-add assessment (pending external validation of dataroom claims)
- **HIGH** for identifying key risks, verification requirements, and recommended actions
- **MEDIUM-HIGH** for overall portfolio quality score (conditional on Figure execution and GP claim verification)
