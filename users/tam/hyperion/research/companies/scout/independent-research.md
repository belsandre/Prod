## Executive Summary

Scout is an early-stage AI-powered sales prospecting platform founded in 2023 by Tanner Baldwin (sales leadership background) and Dean Sloves. With only 7 employees, the company has built a product that helps sales teams import LinkedIn leads, find contact information, and generate AI-powered outreach emails. The company has raised two pre-seed rounds totaling $38K from Hyperion ($15K at $3.3M in April 2023, $23K at $7.5M in January 2024) with Dream Ventures as the only known institutional investor.

**Key Finding**: Despite strong paper returns (6.06x MOIC on Pre-Seed 1), Scout shows characteristics of very early-stage product-market fit with minimal external validation. The projected $20M-$25M seed round referenced in dataroom (Q1 '24) has **not been publicly announced**, raising questions about fundraising progress. The company is a sales SaaS platform, not deeptech, which explains its Tier 2 classification despite strong MOIC performance.

**Confidence Level**: Medium (limited public information, but consistent across available sources)

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Minimal Public Market Presence Despite 2-Year Operating History

**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Evidence**:
- NO press releases or funding announcements found (Web Search, Jan 2025)
- NO customer reviews on G2 or Capterra (G2 page exists but empty/inactive >1 year)
- NO customer logos, case studies, or named references on website
- NO news coverage in tech media (TechCrunch, The Information, etc.)
- Limited social media presence (X/Twitter account exists but minimal activity)

**Assessment**:
Scout has operated in relative stealth since founding (Feb 2023). This is unusual for a SaaS company nearly 2 years old seeking to raise a seed round. Possible explanations:
1. **Deliberate stealth strategy** - focused on product development before marketing
2. **Limited traction** - not enough customer success to publicize
3. **Resource constraints** - team of 7 may lack marketing/PR bandwidth
4. **Pivot or iteration** - product may have evolved significantly, resetting traction timeline

**Red Flag**: Lack of external validation (no reviews, no press, no named customers) makes it difficult to assess actual product-market fit beyond founder-asserted metrics.

---

### Finding 2: Seed Round Status Unclear - Dataroom Projection NOT Publicly Confirmed

**Confidence Level**: HIGH (factual gap)

**Evidence**:
- **Dataroom Projection** (Excel Dec-24E): "Raising seed round in Q1 '24 and already preempted by a VC w/ a $25M post-money valuation"
- **Public Search Results** (Jan 2025): NO announcement of Scout (sales platform) seed round
- **LinkedIn Company Page** (Jan 2025): NO mention of seed round or new funding
- **Crunchbase/PitchBook**: Access blocked, but no results in open web searches

**Timeline Analysis**:
- Pre-Seed 1: April 4, 2023 ($3.3M post-money)
- Pre-Seed 2: January 2, 2024 ($7.5M post-money)
- **Projected Seed**: Q1 '24 at $20M-$25M post-money ← NOT CONFIRMED
- **Current Date**: January 2025 (1 year later)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Seed round did not close** - VC preempt fell through or company couldn't close
2. **Seed round closed privately** - no public announcement (unusual for seed rounds)
3. **Timeline slipped** - round pushed to 2025
4. **Dataroom projection was optimistic** - not actual term sheet

**Assessment**: The absence of any public seed round announcement 1 year after projected Q1 '24 close is a **significant red flag**. Most seed rounds are publicly announced (PR, Crunchbase, tech media). The silence suggests either (1) round didn't happen or (2) company chose extreme stealth (rare for seed-stage SaaS).

**Recommendation**: **Clarify seed round status with Tanner Baldwin or Dillon** before assessing follow-on opportunity.

---

### Finding 3: Some Early Traction Evidence, But Unverified and Limited

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM (company-asserted claims)

**Evidence from LinkedIn/Website**:

**Performance Case Study** (Company-reported):
- 37.5% reply rate on web3 accounting sector outbound campaign
- Achieved without AI personalization or behavioral signals
- Single sector, single campaign

**Growth Signal** (Company-claimed):
- Referrals became "largest lead source"
- Customers "organically promoting Scout without incentives"

**Product Evolution** (2025 Roadmap):
- Expanding from email-only to omni-channel automation
- Adding lookalike matching (advanced targeting)
- Shifting to consumption-based pricing

**Customer Testimonial** (Website):
- Anonymous founder: "booking a meeting from the first email Scout ever wrote"

**Assessment**:
Evidence suggests **some** product-market fit:
- 37.5% reply rate is strong for cold outbound (industry benchmark: 15-25%)
- Referral-driven growth indicates customer satisfaction
- Product roadmap shows company is iterating based on customer feedback
- Consumption pricing shift suggests usage-based value delivery

**However**:
- ALL traction claims are company-asserted (no independent verification)
- Only one specific performance case study (37.5% in web3 sector)
- No customer names, logos, or independent testimonials
- No revenue/ARR metrics disclosed
- Cannot verify "referrals as largest lead source" claim

**Conclusion**: Scout likely has SOME paying customers and positive feedback, but scale of traction is unknown. The 37.5% reply rate case suggests product works when properly deployed, but single data point insufficient to assess broader performance.

---

### Finding 4: Founder Has Strong Sales Domain Expertise, Limited Technical/Startup Experience

**Confidence Level**: HIGH (verified across multiple sources)

**Tanner Baldwin Background** (Verified via LinkedIn, TheOrg):

**Education**:
- University of Oregon, Lundquist College of Business (B.A. in Business Administration)

**Career Progression**:
- **Uber** - Business Development (early career)
- **ZipRecruiter** - Business Development
- **CloudKitchens** - Head of Sales Operations & Marketing (Feb 2018 - May 2021, 3+ years)
- **Teamflow** - Head of Sales (June 2021 - Feb 2023, 1.75 years)
- **Scout** - Founder & CEO (Feb 2023 - Present)

**Strengths**:
- ✓ 5+ years sales leadership experience (CloudKitchens, Teamflow)
- ✓ Deep domain expertise in sales workflows and processes
- ✓ Sales ops background (understands efficiency, automation, data)
- ✓ Experience at high-growth tech companies (Uber, CloudKitchens)
- ✓ "Customer of his own product" - understands pain points firsthand
- ✓ Strong GTM execution skills

**Weaknesses**:
- ✗ No technical background (business degree, sales roles only)
- ✗ First-time founder (no prior exits or startup founding experience)
- ✗ Relatively young career (appears early 30s based on timeline)
- ✗ Limited experience selling to enterprise (SMB/mid-market focused)
- ✗ Relies entirely on CTO (Artur Moczulski) for technical product decisions

**CTO: Artur Moczulski** (identified via LinkedIn):
- Technical co-founder/CTO
- Limited public information available
- Responsible for product engineering

**Assessment**:

Tanner is a **domain expert founder** - deep knowledge of the problem he's solving (sales prospecting pain points) from 5+ years in sales roles. This is valuable for achieving initial product-market fit and iterating quickly with customers.

**Ideal stage**: 0→1 product development with SMB customers. Tanner can sell, understand customer needs, and iterate rapidly.

**Risk areas**: Scaling to enterprise, building deep technical moats, or navigating complex fundraising may require additional leadership or strong board support. First-time founder learning curve.

**Dillon's Value-Add** (from founder testimonial): Helping with GTM strategy, customer introductions, and fundraising education is high-leverage for first-time founder with sales expertise but limited startup/investor experience.

---

### Finding 5: Very Small Team (7 People) Limits Execution Capacity

**Confidence Level**: HIGH (LinkedIn-verified)

**Evidence**:
- LinkedIn lists 7 employees as of January 2025
- Company size band: 2-10 employees
- 2 years post-founding (Feb 2023 → Jan 2025)

**Team Composition** (known roles):
- Tanner Baldwin - CEO & Founder
- Dean Sloves - Co-Founder (role unknown)
- Artur Moczulski - CTO
- 4 other team members (roles unknown)

**Assessment**:

**Implications of 7-person team**:
- **Limited engineering capacity**: Likely 2-3 engineers max (including CTO), constrains product development speed
- **No specialized roles**: Unlikely to have dedicated roles for marketing, customer success, sales engineering, etc.
- **Founder-led sales**: Tanner likely still doing most sales/customer work personally
- **Slow hiring pace**: Only 7 people after 2 years suggests either (1) capital-constrained or (2) deliberately lean

**Positive interpretation**:
- Lean team = low burn rate, longer runway
- Can iterate quickly without organizational overhead
- Focus on product-market fit before scaling

**Negative interpretation**:
- Limited capacity to execute on ambitious 2025 roadmap (omni-channel, lookalike matching)
- May struggle to support growing customer base
- Slow hiring suggests fundraising challenges or conservative approach

**Conclusion**: Team size is appropriate for pre-seed stage but raises questions about readiness for seed-stage growth. If seed round hasn't closed (per Finding #2), team may be capital-constrained and unable to hire.

## Source Quality Analysis

### Sources Collected: 3

**High Objectivity Sources**: 0
- None available (no financial filings, no analyst reports, no third-party coverage)

**Medium Objectivity Sources**: 2
- LinkedIn Company Page (7 employees, founding date, company updates)
- Professional background data (Tanner Baldwin's career history)

**Low Objectivity Sources**: 1
- Company website (product features, marketing claims)

**Gaps**:
- NO customer reviews or testimonials (independent)
- NO news coverage or press releases
- NO funding databases accessible (Crunchbase/PitchBook blocked)
- NO customer names or case studies
- NO revenue/ARR data
- NO information about Dream Ventures involvement beyond dataroom mention

**Source Quality Assessment**: **SEVERELY LIMITED**

For a 2-year-old company that has raised at least 2 funding rounds, the lack of ANY high-objectivity sources or independent validation is unusual. This makes it impossible to verify company-asserted claims about traction, performance, or fundraising status.

---

## Inconsistencies & Red Flags

### Inconsistency 1: Company Location

**Sources Conflict**:
- **LinkedIn**: "New York City, NY 10003, US"
- **PitchBook Search Results**: "Scout (Las Vegas)"
- **Dataroom** (from previous research): Referenced Las Vegas

**Assessment**:
- Company may have relocated NYC → Las Vegas or vice versa
- May have dual offices (HQ + remote team)
- PitchBook may use incorporation location vs. operational HQ

**Resolution Needed**: Clarify primary office location

### Inconsistency 2: Seed Round Status

**Dataroom Claim** (Dec 2024 Excel):
- "Raising seed round in Q1 '24 and already preempted by a VC w/ a $25M post-money valuation"

**Public Reality** (Jan 2025):
- NO announcement of seed round
- NO evidence of fundraising activity
- 1 year past projected Q1 '24 close

**Assessment**: Major discrepancy between dataroom projection and observable reality. Either (1) seed round fell through, (2) timeline slipped significantly, or (3) company is in extreme stealth (unlikely).

**Red Flag Level**: HIGH - suggests fundraising challenges or overly optimistic projections

### Red Flag 1: Absent from Case Studies Despite Strong Returns

**Observation**:
- Scout has 6.06x MOIC (ranks #3 in portfolio)
- Strong IRR: 180.8%
- Top 10 by absolute value ($152K)
- Strong founder testimonial praising Dillon's help

**Yet**:
- NOT featured in Hyperion case studies
- NOT mentioned in GP bio despite strong performance
- NOT listed in sourcing differentiation doc (except one mention)

**Pattern**: Similar to Tier 3 companies (Pierisca, ALL.SPACE) - good returns but not featured in fundraising materials.

**Explanation**: Sales SaaS doesn't fit Hyperion's deeptech thesis (quantum, robotics, fusion, semiconductors). May be excluded from narrative for strategic reasons despite financial performance.

**Assessment**: Not a company quality red flag, but confirms strategic misalignment.

### Red Flag 2: No External Validation After 2 Years

**Observation**:
- Founded Feb 2023 (nearly 2 years ago)
- NO customer reviews on G2 or Capterra
- NO press coverage or media mentions
- NO named customer references
- NO case studies or testimonials (except 1 anonymous founder quote)

**Assessment**: Highly unusual for a B2B SaaS company seeking seed funding. Most companies at this stage have:
- 5-10 customer case studies
- Reviews on G2/Capterra (even if just a few)
- Press announcement of pre-seed or seed rounds
- Some level of inbound interest or PR

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Deliberately operating in stealth (unusual for SaaS)
2. Limited customer traction to publicize
3. Resource constraints (too small to do marketing/PR)
4. Product has pivoted or evolved, resetting customer acquisition

**Red Flag Level**: MEDIUM - concerning but not disqualifying for very early stage

## Areas for Further Research

### Critical Information Gaps

1. **Seed Round Status** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Did Q1 '24 seed round close?
   - If yes: valuation, lead investor, amount raised
   - If no: what happened to VC preempt mentioned in dataroom?
   - Current fundraising status

2. **Customer Traction** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Number of paying customers
   - ARR or MRR run-rate
   - Customer names (even anonymized references: "Series B fintech company")
   - Customer retention/churn rates
   - Average contract size

3. **Product Validation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Independent customer testimonials or references
   - Product reviews (G2, Capterra, or customer interviews)
   - Demo or product trial to verify claimed features
   - Performance data beyond single 37.5% reply rate case

4. **Dream Ventures Involvement** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - What is Dream Ventures' role and involvement?
   - Did Dream Ventures lead a round or participate alongside Hyperion?
   - Is Dream Ventures active/helpful investor?

5. **Competitive Positioning** (Priority: LOW)
   - How does Scout compare to incumbents (ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, Outreach)?
   - What is Scout's defensible differentiation?
   - Market share or competitive win/loss data

6. **2025 Roadmap Execution** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Can 7-person team execute ambitious roadmap?
   - Are they hiring to support growth?
   - Capital availability to fund growth

## Recommendations

### For Hyperion Ventures

**Follow-on Investment Decision**:

**Do NOT participate in seed round (if opportunity arises) unless**:
1. ✓ Seed round status clarified and round is actually happening
2. ✓ Customer traction verified independently (ARR >$500K+ preferred)
3. ✓ Named customer references provided and checked
4. ✓ Valuation is reasonable given limited external validation

**Reasons for Caution**:
- Seed round projected for Q1 '24 has not materialized (1 year later)
- No independent validation of traction claims
- Sales SaaS outside Hyperion's deeptech thesis
- Tiny team (7 people) with limited execution capacity
- Minimal public presence after 2 years
- Unable to verify any dataroom claims independently

**Positive Signals**:
- Strong paper returns (6.06x MOIC) - if valuation holds
- Founder has domain expertise and strong relationship with Dillon
- Some evidence of product-market fit (referrals, 37.5% case)
- Product roadmap shows continued development

**Recommendation**: **HOLD** current position but **DO NOT ADD** capital without significant additional diligence and verification of claims. Consider this a "wait and see" investment.

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Contact Tanner Baldwin** to clarify:
   - Seed round status (closed, in progress, or postponed?)
   - Current ARR and customer count
   - Can he provide 2-3 customer references?

2. **Request from Dillon**:
   - His recent interactions with Tanner (last 6 months)
   - His assessment of company trajectory
   - Any updates on fundraising or traction beyond dataroom

3. **If Follow-on Considered**:
   - Demo the product personally to verify capabilities
   - Speak with at least 3 customers
   - Review financial metrics (ARR, burn rate, runway)
   - Assess whether seed lead investor is high-quality

## GP Relationship Evidence

**Dillon Dunteman's Involvement** (per dataroom):

**Investment**:
- Pre-Seed 1: $15K (April 2023)
- Pre-Seed 2: $23K (January 2024)
- Total: $38K invested

**Value-Add Focus** (per Tanner's testimonial):
- Go-to-market strategy
- Customer introductions
- Fundraising education and investor understanding
- Being "great listener" and understanding founder's perspective

**Founder Testimonial** (Tanner Baldwin):
> "Dillon has been undeniably one of our most helpful investors, shaping our go-to-market strategy and making customer introductions. Dillon has helped us understand how investors think and how to efficiently raise capital. He is a great listener and understands the founder's perspective — he does everything he can to enable us rather than tell us what he thinks is best."

**Relationship Assessment**:
- Strong founder-investor relationship
- Dillon's GTM expertise well-matched to Tanner's needs
- First-time founder benefits from Dillon's fundraising coaching
- Collaborative vs. directive relationship style (Tanner appreciates)

**Why Not Featured in Case Studies?**
- Sales SaaS outside deeptech thesis
- May not fit Hyperion's narrative to LPs
- Pattern similar to other non-deeptech winners (Pierisca, ALL.SPACE)

- Funding databases (Crunchbase, PitchBook) - access blocked

### Limitations

**Severe Information Constraints**:
1. NO high-objectivity sources available (no filings, no analysts, no press)
2. Funding databases blocked (Crunchbase, PitchBook)
3. NO customer references or independent testimonials
4. ALL traction claims are company-asserted and unverified
5. Cannot access Dream Ventures portfolio information
6. No financial metrics disclosed

**What We Cannot Assess**:
- Actual revenue, ARR, or growth metrics
- Customer satisfaction (no reviews)
- Product quality (no independent evaluation)
- Seed round status (no public information)
- Competitive positioning (no comparative data)
- Investment returns accuracy (cannot verify valuation progression)

**Research Quality**: LIMITED

This research provides directional insights but lacks the depth needed for confident investment decision-making. Substantially more information would be required to assess follow-on opportunity.

---

**Research Status**: COMPLETE (for Tier 2 minimum requirements: 3+ sources)

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM (consistent information across sources, but severe external validation gaps)

**Recommendation**: Scout shows signs of early product-market fit but lacks external validation needed to assess true traction or justify follow-on investment without substantial additional diligence. Strategic fit with Hyperion's deeptech thesis is weak. HOLD current position, DO NOT ADD capital without verification of claims.
