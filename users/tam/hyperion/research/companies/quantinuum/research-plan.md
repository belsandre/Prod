## Special Considerations

1. **First in Quantum Cluster**: Must produce comprehensive market analysis to be referenced by Haiqu (Tier 2 quantum company) later
2. **Highest Value Position**: $1.74M current value, deserves thorough analysis
3. **GP Relationship**: Dillon's first formative investment, strong founder testimonial, network hub status
4. **Valuation Discrepancy**: Excel shows $5.5B, case study shows $8.8B - need to clarify
5. **Secondary vs. Institutional**: Understand secondary market valuation vs. last institutional round ($5.3B Feb 2024)

---

## Critical Evaluation Focus

- Verify $8.8B valuation claim (secondary market vs. institutional round)
- Assess commercial traction claims (F500 customers)
- Evaluate competitive positioning claims ("market leader")
- Cross-reference funding amounts and dates
- Look for red flags or negative signals
- Assess quantum computing market maturity and commercialization timeline
