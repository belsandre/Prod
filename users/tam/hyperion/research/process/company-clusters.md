## Research Strategy

**For clustered companies**:

### Quantum Computing Cluster (2 companies)
1. **First: Quantinuum** (Tier 1) - Research deeply including:
   - Comprehensive quantum computing market analysis
   - Competitive landscape (IBM, Google, IonQ, Rigetti, etc.)
   - Market size, trends, and adoption timeline
   - Technology approaches and differentiation

2. **Then: Haiqu** (Tier 2) - Reference Quantinuum's market analysis, focus on:
   - Software platform positioning vs. full-stack hardware players
   - Competitive differentiation within quantum software space
   - Update market trends only if significantly changed since Quantinuum research

### Robotics Cluster (2 companies)
1. **First: Figure AI** (Tier 1) - Research deeply including:
   - Humanoid robotics market analysis
   - Competitive landscape (Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, etc.)
   - Manufacturing automation market size and trends
   - AI + robotics convergence themes

2. **Then: Dirac** (Tier 1) - Reference Figure AI manufacturing market analysis, focus on software-first approach vs. hardware

**Note**: Scout AI (defense robotics) has information gap - cannot research until investment details confirmed

### Fusion Energy Cluster (2 companies)
1. **First: Hephaestus** (Tier 2) - Research including fusion market analysis, competitive landscape, technical approaches
2. **Then: Marathon Fusion** (Tier 2) - Reference Hephaestus market analysis, focus on technical differentiation

### Semiconductors / Hardware Cluster (2 companies)
1. **First: Normal Computing** (Tier 1) - Deep semiconductor and AI hardware market analysis
2. **Then: Mesh Optical** (Tier 2) - Reference datacenter infrastructure analysis, focus on optics-specific positioning

### Single-Company Categories
- **Scout** (Sales Tech) - Full market analysis required
- **Natrion** (Battery) - Full market analysis required
- **Biofire** (Firearms) - Full market analysis required
- **Innerworks** (AI/Cyber) - Full market analysis required
- **Emerge** (Consumer) - Full market analysis required

## Estimated Time Savings

**Clustered research benefit**: ~10 minutes saved per company in same cluster (avoid redundant market research)

**Quantum**: Save ~10 min on Haiqu
**Robotics**: Save ~10 min on Dirac
**Fusion**: Save ~10 min on Marathon Fusion
**Semiconductors**: Save ~10 min on Mesh Optical

**Total estimated time saved**: ~40 minutes across 13 companies

## Quality Thresholds Maintained

Even with cluster efficiencies, maintain minimum source requirements:
- **Tier 1**: 5+ high-quality sources per company
- **Tier 2**: 3+ high-quality sources per company

Cluster strategy reduces redundant market research, NOT company-specific research depth.
