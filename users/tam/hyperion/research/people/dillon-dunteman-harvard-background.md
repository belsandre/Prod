## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**: Multiple independent sources (ResearchGate, GoCrimson.com athletic roster) confirm Harvard affiliation, mechanical engineering degree, and rowing participation. Graduation year of 2019 is consistent with career timeline in pitch materials.

**Limitations**: Specific thesis topic ("vision software for micro-robotic bees" mentioned in pitch deck) not verified in available sources. Quantum computing work mentioned in pitch deck not detailed in these records.

**Biases**: These are factual institutional records with minimal bias.

**Verification Status**:
- ✓ Harvard University attendance confirmed
- ✓ Mechanical Engineering degree confirmed (S.B. '19)
- ✓ Lightweight rowing participation confirmed (2017-18)
- ✓ Graduation year (2019) aligns with stated career timeline
- ? Senior thesis topic on "micro-robotic bees" not independently verified
- ? Quantum computing coursework mentioned in pitch deck not verified

**Inconsistencies**: None identified. All verified information aligns with pitch deck claims.
