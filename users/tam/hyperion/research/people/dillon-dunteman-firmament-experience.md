## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Both exits confirmed by independent third-party sources (acquirers, M&A advisors)
- Transaction values match pitch deck claims exactly ($230M for Envase, $185M for Logistyx)
- Timeline aligns: Dillon was at Firmament 2019-2021, both exits occurred 2022-2023 (after his departure)
- These were legitimate, successful exits to public companies
- PitchBook profile confirms employment at Firmament

**Limitations**:
- Dillon's personal role or attribution in these investments is **not specified** in any external sources
- Exits occurred **after his departure** from Firmament (left Jan 2021, exits in 2022-2023)
- Pitch deck claims ">5x Realized MOIC on Envase" and ">3x Realized MOIC on Logistyx" but these multiples cannot be verified without knowing entry valuations
- Cannot verify if Dillon personally worked on these deals or if they were portfolio companies he inherited
- Pitch deck GP bio states he "helped execute" these deals and they "culminated in two exits" - language is careful but implies involvement

**Biases**: Transaction announcements are factual but don't include attribution to individual team members.

**Verification Status**:
- ✓ Dillon worked at Firmament January 2019 - January 2021
- ✓ Envase sold to WiseTech for $230M in January 2023
- ✓ Logistyx sold to E2open for $185M in March 2022
- ✓ Transaction values match pitch deck exactly
- ? Dillon's personal role in these investments unknown
- ? MOICs (>5x, >3x) cannot be verified without entry valuations
- ⚠️ Exits occurred after Dillon left Firmament

**Inconsistencies**:
- **Timing Issue**: Both exits (2022-2023) occurred **after** Dillon left Firmament (January 2021). This raises questions about attribution.
  - Pitch deck states he "helped execute" buyouts that "culminated in two exits to publicly traded companies"
  - Could mean he worked on acquisitions/growth during his tenure (2019-2021) that later exited (2022-2023)
  - However, this is an important nuance not clearly stated in pitch materials

- Exit #2: Logistyx - **>3x** Realized MOIC - Sold to E2open (NYSE: ETWO) for $185M in Mar-22

**Interpretation**: Language suggests Dillon worked on executing the buyouts and scaling the businesses, which later exited. However, his direct involvement and the magnitude of his contribution cannot be verified.
