- Multiple rowing achievements verified through official sources
- World Indoor Rowing championship win confirmed (high school)
- Head of the Charles 2022 win confirmed for Harvard lightweight 8

- LinkedIn "Stealth" status aligns with Hyperion launch timing

**Limitations**:
- The Raine Group profile NOT found on current team page (may have left, or was advisor/intern role)
- Pitch deck describes role as "venture capital investor and advisor" at Raine - "advisor" language is softer than "employee"
- Cannot verify specific companies he worked with (Bedrock, Garden, Foursquare mentioned in pitch deck)
- Detailed work history and responsibilities unclear

**Biases**: Self-reported LinkedIn information; pitch deck presents achievements in most favorable light.

**Verification Status**:

- ✓ Graduated cum laude confirmed
- ✓ World Indoor Rowing Championship win confirmed (high school)
- ✓ Harvard lightweight crew participation confirmed (2019 sophomore year)

**Inconsistencies**:

1. **Henley Royal Regatta Semi-Finalist Timing Issue**:
   - **Pitch deck claim**: "Henley Royal Regatta Semi-Finalist"
   - **Evidence**: Harvard Men's Lightweight reached Henley semi-finals in **2024**
   - **Problem**: Henry graduated in **2023**, so he would NOT have been on the 2024 boat
   - **Possible explanations**:
     a) Harvard may have reached semi-finals in an earlier year (2021-2023) not found in search
     b) He competed in a different event/boat class at Henley
     c) The claim may be inaccurate or misleading
   - **Status**: Requires clarification

2. **The Raine Group Profile**:
   - **Search results**: Henry Bellew found in searches connected to The Raine Group
   - **Raine Group team page**: Henry Bellew NOT listed on current team roster
   - **Possible explanations**:
     a) He left the firm (consistent with joining Hyperion)
     b) He was an advisor/consultant, not full employee (pitch deck says "advisor")
     c) He was an intern or junior role not listed on main team page
   - **Status**: "Advisor" title in pitch deck may be more accurate than "employee"
