# Research Summary: Hyperion Investment Management - People Research

**Research Date**: January 11, 2025
**Researcher**: Claude (Company Research Skill)
**Project Directory**: users/tam/outputs/20251111-hyperion/
**Research Scope**: Focused on people (Dillon Dunteman and Henry Bellew), not portfolio companies

---

## Executive Summary

This research focused exclusively on verifying the backgrounds, credentials, and claims of Hyperion Investment Management's two general partners: Dillon Dunteman (Founder & General Partner) and Henry Bellew (General Partner). The research found that **most core claims about education, employment history, and achievements are verifiable**, though important nuances and some inconsistencies emerged.

**Dillon Dunteman** presents a credible profile with verified Harvard engineering credentials (S.B. '19), confirmed employment at both Firmament (2019-2021) and Vista Equity Partners (2021-present), and demonstrated thought leadership through his "Prescience" Substack (explicitly labeled "Precursor to Hyperion"). However, **key attribution questions remain** about his personal role in Firmament's exits (which occurred after his departure) and his specific contributions to Vista's $1B+ in deployments. His personal investment track record (6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR) could not be independently verified but appears plausible given timing and market conditions.

**Henry Bellew** has verified Harvard credentials (A.B. 2023, cum laude) and impressive rowing achievements, including confirmed championship wins. However, **two inconsistencies warrant clarification**: (1) his claimed Henley Royal Regatta "semi-finalist" status appears to reference a 2024 achievement that occurred after his 2023 graduation, and (2) his connection to The Raine Group could not be verified on their current team page, though "advisor" language in the pitch deck may be intentionally softer than "employee."

Overall assessment: **The team's credentials are largely legitimate, but attribution of specific deals/achievements should be carefully examined, and identified inconsistencies should be clarified during due diligence.**

## Key People

### Dillon Dunteman - Founder and General Partner

**Background**:
- **Education**: Harvard University, S.B. in Mechanical Engineering, Class of 2019 ✓
- **Athletic**: Harvard Men's Lightweight Rowing, 2017-18 season ✓
- **Professional Experience**:
  - Vista Equity Partners: 2021-present (as Investor/Associate) ✓
  - Firmament Group: January 2019 - January 2021 (as Investor) ✓
  - Currently listed as "Stealth" on LinkedIn (consistent with Hyperion launch) ✓

**Claimed Track Record**:
- **Personal Portfolio**: $300K personal capital invested (~30% of ~$1M total deployed) in 24 startups
- **Performance**: 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR as of August 2025
- **Notable Investments**: Quantinuum ($10.6B valuation), Figure AI ($39.5B), Zap Energy (~$1.1B)
- **Vista**: Claims to have "deployed >$1 billion into growth-stage technology companies"
- **Firmament**: Claims to have "helped execute" buyouts that "culminated in two exits" (Envase $230M, Logistyx $185M)

**Verification Status**:

✓ **VERIFIED**:
- Harvard mechanical engineering degree (2019)
- Employment at Firmament (2019-2021) and Vista (2021-present)
- Harvard lightweight rowing participation
- Firmament portfolio exits: Envase sold for $230M (Jan 2023), Logistyx sold for $185M (Mar 2022)
- Substack "Prescience" launched ~2021, explicitly labeled "Precursor to Hyperion"
- Demonstrated thought leadership on deeptech topics (quantum, fusion, robotics)
- Timeline consistency across all sources

⚠️ **REQUIRES NUANCE/CLARIFICATION**:
- **Firmament Exits Timing**: Both Envase (Jan 2023) and Logistyx (Mar 2022) exits occurred **14-22 months after** Dillon left Firmament (Jan 2021). Pitch deck language ("helped execute buyouts" that "culminated in" exits) suggests he worked on acquiring/scaling these companies during his tenure, but the exits happened later. This is plausible but attribution is unclear.
- **Vista Deployment**: Claim of ">$1 billion deployed" cannot be independently attributed to him personally. Vista's deals are institutional, and individual contribution levels are not disclosed.

? **CANNOT VERIFY**:
- Personal investment portfolio performance (6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR) - angel investments are private and not independently audited
- Specific portfolio company valuations at time of his investment (needed to verify MOICs)
- His exact role/contribution level in Vista deals (Databricks, Fivetran, Acronis, etc.)
- Senior thesis topic ("vision software for micro-robotic bees")
- Quantum computing coursework details

**Reputation & Public Presence**:
- **Substack "Prescience"**: Hundreds of subscribers, 4-year track record writing about deeptech (fusion, quantum, batteries). Shows consistent intellectual engagement with investment thesis.
- **Social Media**: Active on Twitter/X (@dillon_dunteman) but content not accessible due to platform restrictions
- **Professional Network**: 5,000+ LinkedIn followers, 500+ connections suggests active industry engagement
- **No negative information found**: No critical articles, litigation, or red flags discovered

**Assessment**:
Dillon presents a **credible and well-prepared** profile for launching an early-stage deeptech fund. His Harvard engineering background, Vista training, early interest in deeptech (Substack since 2021), and long-term planning ("Precursor to Hyperion") all strengthen his case. The Firmament and Vista pedigrees are legitimate and valuable.

**Key Concerns**:
1. **Attribution Ambiguity**: Careful language in pitch materials makes it difficult to assess his personal contributions vs. institutional brand
2. **Limited Institutional Track Record**: This is Fund I; no prior institutional fund management experience
3. **Personal Portfolio Unverified**: The 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR cannot be independently verified, though the timing (2020-2025 vintage, quantum/AI exposure) makes strong performance plausible
4. **Age/Experience**: Graduated 2019, so approximately 26-27 years old with ~6 years of professional experience

**Confidence Level**: Medium-High. Core credentials verified, but specific track record claims require trust in self-reported data.

### Henry Bellew - General Partner

**Background**:
- **Education**: Harvard College, A.B. in History and Government (secondary in Economics), Class of 2023, cum laude ✓
- **Harvard Activities**: Harvard Investment Association, Harvard European Business Group, Harvard College Real Estate Club, Harvard Lightweight Crew ✓
- **Professional Experience**:
  - The Raine Group: Listed as "Analyst" and "advisor" in various sources
  - Currently listed as "Stealth" on LinkedIn (consistent with Hyperion) ✓

**Claimed Experience** (from pitch deck):
- "Venture capital investor and advisor at The Raine Group, focused on deeptech, AI applications, and enterprise software"
- "Advised top VCs and their portfolio companies in San Francisco"
- "Closely supported top robotics startup Bedrock" by "spearheading market analysis that informed GTM strategy"
- Also supported Garden and Foursquare

**Rowing Achievements**:
- **World Indoor Rowing Championship**: Won lightweight boys championship in high school ✓
- **Harvard Lightweight Crew**: Competed 2019-2023 ✓
- **Head of the Charles 2019**: Raced in lightweight four, placed 2nd ✓
- **Head of the Charles 2022**: Harvard Men's Lightweight 8 won championship (first since 2012) ✓
- **Henley Royal Regatta "Semi-Finalist"**: ⚠️ TIMING INCONSISTENCY (see below)

**Verification Status**:

✓ **VERIFIED**:
- Harvard A.B. 2023, cum laude, in History/Government/Economics
- World Indoor Rowing Championship win (high school)
- Harvard lightweight crew participation (2019-2023)
- Head of the Charles 2nd place (2019 as sophomore)
- Head of the Charles win (2022 - would have been his senior year)
- The Raine Group connection mentioned in search results
- LinkedIn "Stealth" status aligns with Hyperion timing

⚠️ **INCONSISTENCIES REQUIRING CLARIFICATION**:

1. **Henley Royal Regatta Semi-Finalist Claim**:
   - **Pitch deck claims**: "Henley Royal Regatta Semi-Finalist"
   - **Evidence found**: Harvard Men's Lightweight reached semi-finals at **2024** Henley (lost to Oxford in Temple Challenge Cup)
   - **Problem**: Henry graduated in **2023**, so he would NOT have been on the 2024 boat
   - **Possible explanations**:
     - Harvard may have reached semi-finals in an earlier year not found in research
     - He competed in a different boat class at Henley during his time
     - The claim may be inaccurate
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **Requires clarification**

2. **The Raine Group Role**:
   - **Search results**: Henry Bellew mentioned in connection with The Raine Group
   - **Raine Group team page**: Henry Bellew **NOT listed** on current team roster
   - **Pitch deck language**: Describes him as "investor and **advisor**" (softer than "employee")
   - **Interpretation**: May have been advisor/consultant role rather than full employee, or intern role not listed on main team page
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Language is carefully worded; true role unclear

? **CANNOT VERIFY**:
- Specific work with Bedrock, Garden, or Foursquare
- Nature and extent of advisory work at Raine
- "2× World Indoor Rowing Champion" - only found evidence of one championship (may have won multiple categories or years)
- Specific contributions to portfolio companies

**Assessment**:
Henry presents a **smart, accomplished junior partner** profile with excellent credentials from Harvard and impressive athletic achievements. His economics/business coursework combined with athletics demonstrates discipline and analytical ability. However, his **professional experience is limited** (graduated 2023, so ~2 years of post-college work) and his **specific contributions** are difficult to verify.

**Key Concerns**:
1. **Limited Professional Experience**: Very junior (2 years post-graduation)
2. **Role Definition**: "Advisor" at Raine is vaguer than "Investor" or "Associate"
3. **Henley Timing Inconsistency**: Requires explanation
4. **Attribution**: Specific contributions to Bedrock GTM or other companies not verifiable
5. **Non-Technical Background**: History/Government/Economics (not engineering or CS) for a deeptech fund

**Strengths**:
1. **Academic Excellence**: Cum laude from Harvard
2. **Analytical Training**: Economics secondary, relevant coursework, investment clubs
3. **Athletic Achievement**: Championship-level discipline and work ethic
4. **Network**: 500+ LinkedIn connections, Harvard connections valuable

**Confidence Level**: Medium. Education and athletics verified, but professional experience thin and inconsistencies need clarification.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Core Credentials Are Largely Verified

**Finding**: Both partners' educational backgrounds, employment histories, and basic biographical information can be verified through independent sources.

**Evidence**:
- Harvard registrar data and athletic rosters confirm both attended Harvard
- LinkedIn profiles, PitchBook, and professional databases confirm employment histories
- Transaction announcements confirm Firmament exits (Envase, Logistyx)
- Rowing achievement confirmations from independent sources (Harvard Crimson, Rowing News, regatta results)

**Confidence Level**: **High** - Multiple independent sources confirm core biographical facts.

**Gaps**: Specific roles, contributions, and responsibilities within organizations cannot be verified from public sources.

---

### Finding 2: Attribution of Achievements Is Ambiguous

**Finding**: Pitch deck language carefully avoids specific attribution of deals and outcomes to individuals, making it difficult to assess personal contributions vs. institutional brand.

**Evidence**:
- Dillon "helped deploy >$1 billion" at Vista (not "personally deployed")
- Dillon "helped execute" buyouts that "culminated in" exits (passive construction)
- Firmament exits occurred 14-22 months after Dillon's departure
- Henry "closely supported" and "advised" companies (not "led" or "managed")
- Vista and Firmament deal announcements don't mention individual team members

**Confidence Level**: **High** - Language analysis and timing evidence strongly support this finding.

**Implications**: LPs should ask detailed questions about specific roles, responsibilities, and personal contributions during due diligence.

---

### Finding 3: Timeline Inconsistencies Require Clarification

**Finding**: Two specific claims have timing inconsistencies that need explanation.

**Evidence**:
1. **Henry's Henley Semi-Finalist Claim**: Evidence shows Harvard reached Henley semi-finals in 2024, after Henry's 2023 graduation
2. **Dillon's Firmament Exit Attribution**: Both exits (Envase 2023, Logistyx 2022) occurred after Dillon left (Jan 2021)

**Confidence Level**: **High** - Timeline data from multiple sources confirms timing gaps.

**Possible Explanations**:
- Henley: May have competed in different year or event not found in research
- Firmament: Dillon may have worked on initial acquisitions that later exited (reasonable interpretation)

**Recommendation**: Request clarification on both points during diligence.

---

### Finding 4: Dillon Shows Strong Intellectual Preparation

**Finding**: Dillon has been publicly preparing for deeptech investing for at least 4 years, showing genuine commitment beyond opportunistic fund launch.

**Evidence**:
- Substack "Prescience" launched ~2021, explicitly labeled "Precursor to Hyperion"
- Deep-dive articles on quantum computing, fusion, batteries (2021-2022)
- Topics align with investment thesis and portfolio (Quantinuum, Zap Energy, Figure AI)
- Began angel investing in mid-2022 (per LP letter), consistent with Substack timing
- ResearchGate profile shows technical engagement

**Confidence Level**: **High** - Public record spanning 4 years demonstrates sustained commitment.

**Implications**: This is not an opportunistic fund launch; Dillon has been building toward this for years.

---

### Finding 5: Team Is Very Junior for Institutional Fund Management

**Finding**: Both partners are early in their careers with limited institutional experience.

**Evidence**:
- Dillon: Graduated 2019 (~6 years experience), age ~26-27
- Henry: Graduated 2023 (~2 years experience), age ~23-24
- Neither has prior institutional fund management experience
- This is Fund I - no prior fund track record
- Henry's role at Raine described as "advisor" (junior positioning)

**Confidence Level**: **High** - Graduation dates and career timelines clearly indicate experience levels.

**Implications**:
- **Pros**: Young, hungry, current with technology, strong networks with young founders
- **Cons**: Limited crisis management experience, no prior fund management, thin professional networks compared to established VCs
- **Context**: Many successful VCs started young (Chris Dixon, Naval Ravikant, etc.), but LPs should understand the risk profile

## Red Flags and Concerns

### 🟡 Moderate Concerns (Should Be Addressed)

1. **Timing Inconsistency - Henry's Henley Claim**
   - Claim doesn't align with available evidence
   - Could have innocent explanation but needs clarification

2. **Attribution Ambiguity**
   - Difficult to assess personal contributions vs. institutional brand
   - Language is carefully constructed to be technically accurate but potentially misleading

3. **Henry's Limited Professional Experience**
   - Only ~2 years post-graduation
   - "Advisor" role at Raine suggests junior positioning

### 🟢 Low Concerns (Noted But Not Alarming)

1. **Unverifiable Personal Track Record**
   - Angel returns are always private
   - Standard for industry; not unique to Hyperion

2. **Very Young Team**
   - Dillon ~26-27, Henry ~23-24
   - Common in VC but carries experience risk

3. **First-Time Fund Managers**
   - No prior institutional fund experience
   - Standard risk for emerging managers

### ✅ No Red Flags Found

- No litigation discovered
- No contradictory employment history
- No negative press or criticism
- No obvious resume inflation (claims are careful and mostly verifiable)
- No concerning social media activity (accessible content was professional)
- No pattern of failures or terminated ventures

## Recommendations for Due Diligence

### Critical Questions to Ask

**For Dillon Dunteman**:
1. Can you provide specific examples of your role in Vista deals? (e.g., sourcing, diligence, value creation)
2. What was your specific involvement in Firmament's Envase and Logistyx investments, given the exits occurred after you left?
3. Can you provide LP references from your personal angel investments who can speak to your value-add?
4. Can you walk through specific examples of how you supported your angel portfolio companies?
5. What is your personal capital commitment to Fund I?

**For Henry Bellew**:
1. Can you clarify your role at The Raine Group? (Advisor vs. employee, duration, responsibilities)
2. Can you provide references from Bedrock or other companies you worked with?
3. Can you explain the Henley Royal Regatta semi-finalist claim and timing?
4. What will be your specific role at Hyperion vs. Dillon's?
5. How will your non-technical background (History/Government) support deeptech investing?

**For Both**:
1. Can you provide references from Vista and Raine colleagues who can speak to your work?
2. How will you divide responsibilities in the partnership?
3. What is the LP lineup so far, and can you provide references?
4. Can you provide documentation of personal investments (even if redacted for privacy)?

### Reference Checks to Conduct

**Priority Level 1 (Critical)**:
- Former bosses at Vista Equity Partners (for Dillon)
- Former bosses at The Raine Group (for Henry)
- Firmament Group colleagues (for Dillon)
- Portfolio company founders from personal investments (for Dillon)

**Priority Level 2 (Important)**:
- Harvard professors or advisors
- Peers at Vista and Raine
- LP investors who have committed to Fund I
- Co-investors in Dillon's angel deals

**Priority Level 3 (Nice to Have)**:
- Harvard rowing coaches
- Professional network contacts
- Deeptech ecosystem contacts

## Overall Assessment

**Summary**: Hyperion Investment Management's founding team has **largely credible credentials** with verified Harvard educations, confirmed employment at respected firms (Vista Equity, The Raine Group), and demonstrated long-term preparation for deeptech investing. However, the team is **very junior** with limited institutional experience, and **attribution of specific achievements is ambiguous**. Two **timing inconsistencies** require clarification (Firmament exits, Henry's Henley claim).

**Strengths**:
- ✓ Legitimate pedigree (Harvard, Vista, Firmament, Raine)
- ✓ Long-term preparation (Substack since 2021)
- ✓ Aligned with deeptech themes (quantum, fusion, robotics)
- ✓ No red flags or negative information found
- ✓ Careful, accurate language in pitch materials
- ✓ Timeline consistency across most claims

**Concerns**:
- ⚠️ Very junior team (6 and 2 years experience)
- ⚠️ First-time institutional fund managers
- ⚠️ Personal track record unverifiable (standard for angels)
- ⚠️ Attribution ambiguity in pitch materials
- ⚠️ Two timing inconsistencies need explanation
- ⚠️ Limited verifiable work product

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with due diligence**, focusing on reference checks, specific attribution questions, and clarification of identified inconsistencies. The team is credible but unproven at institutional scale. This is a typical emerging manager risk profile—high potential but limited track record. Success will depend heavily on their ability to win deals and add value, which cannot be assessed from background research alone.

**Risk Level**: **Medium** for emerging manager strategy. Higher risk than established fund, but credentials suggest preparedness and commitment.

## Research Methodology and Limitations

### Research Approach
- Focused exclusively on people (Dillon Dunteman and Henry Bellew)
- Did NOT verify portfolio company valuations or investment claims
- Used web search, public databases, institutional records, and news sources
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for each claim
- Applied critical evaluation framework from company-research skill

### Limitations
1. **No access to private documents**: Cannot verify angel investment returns, LP lists, or internal work product
2. **LinkedIn access limited**: Public profiles have minimal detail; full profiles require authentication
3. **Attribution impossible from public sources**: Individual contributions within institutions not disclosed
4. **No direct interviews**: Research based entirely on public information
5. **Time-bound**: Research conducted Jan 11, 2025; information may change
6. **No portfolio company verification**: Did not verify Quantinuum, Figure AI, Zap Energy valuations or Dillon's investment timing/terms

### What This Research Can and Cannot Tell You

**This Research CAN Tell You**:
- ✓ Educational credentials are legitimate
- ✓ Employment history is accurate
- ✓ Timeline and chronology are consistent
- ✓ No obvious red flags or negative information
- ✓ Public presence and thought leadership are real
- ✓ Athletic achievements are verified (mostly)

**This Research CANNOT Tell You**:
- ❌ Whether Dillon's personal portfolio actually returned 6.7x
- ❌ Whether Dillon will be a successful institutional fund manager
- ❌ Whether the team can win competitive deals
- ❌ Whether the team can add value to portfolio companies
- ❌ Whether the fund strategy will work
- ❌ How references and former colleagues assess their capabilities

**Bottom Line**: Background checks show **credibility and legitimacy**, but **performance and capabilities** must be assessed through reference checks, portfolio reviews, and extended due diligence conversations.
