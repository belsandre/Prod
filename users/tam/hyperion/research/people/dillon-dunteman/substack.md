## Critical Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Demonstrates long-term engagement with deeptech topics (fusion, quantum, batteries) that align with Hyperion's stated investment thesis
- Tagline "Precursor to Hyperion" shows intentional planning of the firm over multiple years
- Launch timing (2021) aligns with pitch deck claim that he "began angel investing" in mid-2022 after the market correction
- In-depth technical articles suggest domain expertise
- Consistent focus on investor perspective and commercialization timelines

**Limitations**:
- Self-published content without editorial oversight or fact-checking
- Represents author's personal views and investment thesis
- Subscriber count ("hundreds") is modest but reasonable for niche deeptech content
- Cannot verify accuracy of technical analysis without domain expertise

**Biases**:
- Explicitly promotional toward Hyperion ("Precursor to Hyperion")
- Author has financial interest in promoting deeptech investment thesis
- Selection of topics aligns with personal investment portfolio (quantum, fusion, etc.)
- Framing from investor perspective, not neutral technical analysis

**Verification Status**:
- ✓ Substack exists and is authored by Dillon Dunteman
- ✓ Launch timing (4 years ago / 2021) aligns with stated timeline
- ✓ Topic focus (quantum, fusion, batteries) consistent with Hyperion thesis
- ✓ "Precursor to Hyperion" tagline confirms long-term planning
- ? Technical accuracy of content not independently verified
- ✓ Timing aligns with beginning of angel investing phase

**Inconsistencies**: None identified. Substack content and timing align with pitch deck narrative about planning Hyperion while at Vista and beginning angel investing.
