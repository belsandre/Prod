## Additional Context from Website

The minimalist website design suggests early-stage company still building out public presence. The focus on "demo" rather than "free trial" or "sign up" indicates enterprise/B2B sales approach rather than self-service product.

The tagline "Clumsy hardware needs Careful Software" effectively communicates value proposition: quantum hardware has limitations (clumsy), their software optimizes it (careful). This aligns with technical positioning in press materials.

Lack of detailed public information typical for:
1. Early-stage deeptech companies protecting IP
2. Enterprise-focused companies (don't need consumer-facing details)
3. Companies still refining product-market fit
4. Companies prioritizing direct sales over inbound marketing
