## Technical Risk Assessment

### Biometric Reliability Concerns

**Fingerprint Challenges**:
- Wet hands (rain, sweat, blood)
- Dirty hands (gun owners may have oil, grease)
- Gloves (cold weather use)
- Hand positioning (stress affects grip)
- Aging (fingerprints change over time)

**Facial Recognition Challenges**:
- Low light conditions (nighttime home intrusion)
- Face coverings (pandemic relevance, cold weather)
- Facial hair changes (beard growth)
- Glasses, makeup, aging

**Dual Biometric Advantage**:
- Either fingerprint OR facial can unlock (increases success rate)
- Redundancy reduces false negative risk

**Unknown**: Biofire has not disclosed false negative rate (critical metric for life-or-death device).

### Battery Dependency Risk

**Critical Question**: What happens when battery dies?
- Does gun fire at all? (Fail-safe vs. fail-secure tradeoff)
- How long does battery last? (Days, weeks, months?)
- Can user tell battery status? (Warning indicators?)
- Emergency override method? (Mechanical backup?)

**Biofire Has Not Disclosed**: Battery specs, failure modes, or override mechanisms.
