# Scout - Research Summary

**Company**: Scout (NOTE: Not "Scout AI" defense robotics company)

**Research Date**: 2025-11-12
**Researcher**: VC Research Workflow (Hyperion Ventures Due Diligence)
**Research Purpose**: Tier 1 Priority Company Assessment

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RESEARCH ISSUE: Company Identity Ambiguity

### Problem
The dataroom references "Scout AI" with CEO **Tanner Baldwin**, but public research reveals TWO distinct companies with similar names:

1. **Scout** (Sales Platform)
   - Founded by **Tanner Baldwin** & Dean Sloves (2023)
   - AI-powered sales prospecting platform
   - Based in New York City / Las Vegas
   - 1 institutional investor: Dream Ventures
   - NO robotics focus

2. **Scout AI** (Defense Robotics)
   - Founded by **Colby Adcock** & Collin Otis (August 2024)
   - Defense robotics with Fury VLA foundation model
   - $15M seed (April 2025) from Align Ventures, Booz Allen Ventures
   - Based in Sunnyvale, CA
   - NOT founded by Tanner Baldwin

### Dataroom Information
- **Founder/CEO**: Tanner Baldwin
- **Investment Dates**: April 4, 2023 (Pre-Seed 1); January 2, 2024 (Pre-Seed 2)
- **Valuations**: $3.3M (Pre-Seed 1); $7.5M (Pre-Seed 2)
- **Investments**: $15K (Pre-Seed 1); $23K (Pre-Seed 2)
- **Listed Under**: "Humanoid Robotics Leader" sourcing network
- **Founder Testimonial**: Provided by Tanner Baldwin
- **Description**: Listed as robotics-related

### Analysis of Discrepancy
Based on **Tanner Baldwin** as CEO and **2023-2024 investment dates**, this MUST be **Scout** (sales platform), NOT Scout AI (defense robotics). However:

**Inconsistency**: Dataroom lists company under "Humanoid Robotics Leader" network and describes robotics focus, but Tanner Baldwin's Scout is a SALES PLATFORM, not robotics.

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Company Pivot**: Scout may have started in robotics then pivoted to sales platform
2. **Documentation Error**: Dataroom may have confused two different Scout companies
3. **Early Stage**: Company may have been exploring robotics initially (2023) before finding product-market fit in sales
4. **Network Classification Error**: Listed under wrong sourcing category

**Resolution Required**: Clarify with Dillon Dunteman or Tanner Baldwin:
- What is Scout's actual product/market?
- Is there any robotics connection?
- Has company pivoted from initial thesis?

## Limited Research Findings

### Company: Scout (Sales Platform)

**What We Know** (from limited public sources):
- **Founded**: 2023
- **Founders**: Dean Sloves, Tanner Baldwin
- **CEO**: Tanner Baldwin
- **Product**: AI-based sales prospecting platform
  - Finds prospects' work emails and mobile numbers
  - Writes personalized sales emails using AI
  - Manages imported leads from LinkedIn
- **Investor**: Dream Ventures (1 institutional investor)
- **Location**: New York City (also references to Las Vegas)
- **Website**: https://www.tryscout.ai/

### Tanner Baldwin Background
- **Current**: Founder & CEO, Scout (2023-present)
- **Previous Roles**:
  - Head of Sales, Teamflow (June 2021 - February 2023)
  - Head of Sales Operations & Marketing, CloudKitchens
  - Business Development roles at ZipRecruiter and Uber

**Assessment**: Sales/GTM focused background, NOT robotics or deep tech

### Founder Testimonial (from dataroom)
**Tanner Baldwin, CEO & Co-Founder, Scout:**
> "Dillon has been undeniably one of our most helpful investors, shaping our go-to-market strategy and making customer introductions. Dillon has helped us understand how investors think and how to efficiently raise capital. He is a great listener and understands the founder's perspective — he does everything he can to enable us rather than tell us what he thinks is best."

**Analysis**: Testimonial confirms:
- Strong relationship with Dillon
- Focus on go-to-market strategy (consistent with sales platform)
- Help with fundraising and investor education
- Does NOT mention robotics, hardware, or technical product

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Company Identity Requires Clarification
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (factual discrepancy)

**Evidence**:
- Dataroom lists "Scout AI" under robotics with Tanner Baldwin as CEO
- Public sources show Tanner Baldwin's Scout is a SALES PLATFORM
- No public evidence of robotics connection
- Founder background (sales/GTM at Uber, ZipRecruiter, CloudKitchens) does NOT align with robotics

**Recommendation**: **CRITICAL - Clarify actual company product/market with founder before proceeding with investment analysis**

### Finding 2: Very Limited Public Information Available
**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**What's Missing**:
- NO press releases or news articles about Scout (sales platform)
- NO customer names or case studies
- NO revenue or traction metrics
- NO detailed product information
- NO competitive positioning
- NO team information beyond founders
- NO valuation or funding details beyond Dream Ventures

**Assessment**: Either:
1. Very early stage with minimal traction (pre-product-market fit)
2. Operating in stealth mode
3. Limited market presence/adoption

### Finding 3: Dataroom Projections Cannot Be Verified
**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM

**Dataroom Claims** (cannot verify):
- Excel shows $20M+ post-money valuation projection for seed round
- "Raising seed round in Q1 '24 and already preempted by a VC w/ a $25M post-money valuation"
- MOIC: 6.06x (Pre-Seed 1); 2.67x (Pre-Seed 2) based on $20M+ projection
- Combined current value: $152,242 based on projections

**Issue**: NO public information confirms:
- Seed round close or timing
- $20M-$25M valuation
- VC preempt
- Any customer or revenue traction

**Assessment**: Projections are speculative without verification

## Unable to Complete Standard Research

Due to limited public information and company identity ambiguity, I CANNOT provide:
- Product-market fit assessment
- Competitive analysis
- Customer traction verification
- Team evaluation beyond founder backgrounds
- Technology validation
- Market sizing
- Financial projections validation

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
1. **Clarify Company Identity**:
   - Confirm Scout's actual product (sales platform vs. robotics)
   - If robotics: what product, what stage, what differentiation?
   - If sales platform: why listed under robotics network?
   - Has company pivoted?

2. **Request Company Information**:
   - Pitch deck or investor update
   - Product demo or description
   - Customer list and traction metrics
   - Actual revenue/ARR (if any)
   - Team composition
   - Fundraise status (seed round details)

3. **Verify Dataroom Claims**:
   - $20M-$25M seed valuation projection
   - VC preempt claim
   - Current company status and activity level

### IF Scout is Sales Platform (Most Likely)
- Assess product-market fit in competitive sales tech market
- Evaluate against incumbents (ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, Outreach, SalesLoft, etc.)
- Understand customer acquisition and retention
- Assess founder's sales background as strength for GTM
- Question: Why invest in sales tech vs. deeptech thesis?

### IF Scout Has Robotics Component (Unlikely Given Evidence)
- Request technical details and differentiation
- Understand pivot timeline and rationale
- Assess founder's technical credibility for robotics
- Evaluate against humanoid robotics competitors

## GP Relationship Evidence

**Dillon Dunteman's Involvement** (per dataroom):
- **Value-Add Focus**: Go-to-market strategy, customer introductions, fundraising education

- **Relationship Strength**: "Undeniably one of our most helpful investors"

### Founder Testimonial (Tanner Baldwin, CEO & Co-Founder)
> "Dillon has been undeniably one of our most helpful investors, shaping our go-to-market strategy and making customer introductions. Dillon has helped us understand how investors think and how to efficiently raise capital. He is a great listener and understands the founder's perspective — he does everything he can to enable us rather than tell us what he thinks is best."

   - **Assessment**: Vague claim; could range from minor input to major strategic overhaul

2. **Claim**: "Making customer introductions"
   - **Verification Attempt**: WebSearch unavailable
   - **Result**: ❌ Cannot verify specific customer introductions or outcomes
   - **Assessment**: Specific customers should be verifiable; critical for B2B sales platform

3. **Claim**: "Undeniably one of our most helpful investors"
   - **Verification Attempt**: WebSearch unavailable
   - **Result**: ❌ Cannot verify comparative helpfulness vs. other investors
   - **Assessment**: Superlative language common in testimonials; may be fundraising-optimized
