MOICs and IRRs are net of fees and expenses. Valuation inputs for MOIC calculations include valuation caps on latest convertible note or SAFE rounds. Current Quantinuum valuation is based on recent secondary transaction in March 2025 but note that the last institutional equity financing round occurred in February 2024 at a $5.3 billion post-money valuation. Normal Computing investments were made through the Hyperion Opportunity SPV SAFE rounds. Furthermore, certain investments were made in Mr. Dunleman's individual capacity and are thus not comparable to future fund investments.
