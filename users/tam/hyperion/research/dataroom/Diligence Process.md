## Diligence Process Overview

### 1. Call Preparation

**Complete in-depth research on founder background, technology, academic work, and broader market dynamics / competitive landscape.**

**Goal is to ask highly nuanced questions to (i) qualify the investment correctly, and (ii) demonstrate deeper understanding of their business and market than other VCs.**

**Proactively brainstorm top 2-3 ways to help.**

### 2. Intro Call

**Initial questions focus on (i) founder background and motivation, (ii) data points on customer problem set and estimated product ROI, (iii) testing their understanding of market backdrop and competitive landscape, and (iv) aptitude for GTM and commercial business build-out.**

**At end of call, ask founders about their current top priority that they need help with.**

### 3. Diligence Workflows

#### In-Person Meetings

• Visit startup HQ and spend meaningful time in-person to better understand founder aptitude and build personal trust.

#### Investment Memo

• Draft robust investment memo with deep insights on the company, market participants, thesis & risks, and founder evaluation.

#### References

• Complete at least 15-20 references across customers, partners, former colleagues, investors, and/or competitors to attain broad set of perspectives.

#### Create Value on Top Priority

• Intensely focus on founders' stated top priority and over-deliver relative to expectations.

### 4. Round Commitment

**Once high conviction is built, Hyperion verbally commits to investing.**

**Hyperion then either:**

**(1)** Invests capital as quickly as possible via capped SAFE, or

**(2)** If needed, focus intently on bringing in a friendly lead or co-lead investor who will preserve Hyperion allocation representing 3%+ ownership.
