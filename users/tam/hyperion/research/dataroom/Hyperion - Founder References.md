**$10.8bn valuation**

```
When I first met Dillon 6 years ago, he demonstrated extensive technical understanding of the quantum computing industry and our differentiated position in the market — better than all of the major venture firms that I spoke with during our fundraise process.

Dillon has continued to hold strategic conversations with myself and other leaders on my team. He has also provided valuable guidance to other quantum startups that I am close with, with those founders speaking very highly of him.

I believe he will build an outstanding investment firm that will succeed within quantum computing and beyond. I look forward to our continued partnership as he embarks on this next chapter.

NORMAL [logo]

**$17mm Series A raise**

```
Dillon is a rare investor who combines founder-first tact with genuine deep technical insight, including a principled view of new-era business models and growth.

Dillon embodies grit – and ultimately grit and character is what founders respect most. When we needed hands the most, Dillon was there, clearing his weekend to help on strategy, talent, and other critical initiatives for my company.

I believe that the best investors feel they perpetually need to earn their right to win. Dillon has a right to win in deeptech and will continue to cement that advantage over other investors. He will always be one of my first phone calls when raising a new round.

### Isaiah Taylor
CEO & Co-Founder
VALOR ATOMICS [logo]

**>$100mm total raised**

```
Dillon has earned my respect through the quality of his ideas, his hustle, and his alignment with our mission. He is also one of the few investors who simultaneously has a strong grasp of Valor's technical differentiation as well as deep understanding of the broader strategic picture.

Dillon's financial acumen will be an important tool as we scale and raise more debt and equity capital. I would recommend him without hesitation to any founder seeking a long-term, high-impact partner.

I'm thrilled to have Dillon's support as the first investment for his new firm, and I want to work with him for many years to come as he builds Hyperion.

**$6mm Seed raise**

```
Dillon has been incredible to have on our team.

He is sharp, mission-aligned, and deeply cares about helping the founders that he works with win.

His insights and perspective have been something that I've come to value and lean on while building Dirac, and I'd recommend working with Dillon to any founder I know.

CEO & Co-Founder

**>$80mm total raised**

```
Dillon understands the fundamentals behind a company, its technology vision, and how it might fit into the market. I've been impressed by the depth of his analysis, and I find that he does a better job at it than some of the largest venture firms. He's also hard-working and scarily determined in the same way that the best startup founders are.

When Dillon wanted to participate in an oversubscribed round, we fought to find room for his investment because he's somebody we want on our cap table.

### Aran Khanna
CEO & Co-Founder
Archera [logo]

**>$27mm total raised**

```
Dillon stands out as best-in-class among investors for his rare combination of deep technical understanding and strategic vision, which has been instrumental in helping Archera navigate critical inflection points from Series A through B.

His ability to be both a rigorous strategic thought partner and long-term capital partner sets him apart from typical early-stage investors, and we would eagerly welcome his continued investment in our future rounds.

### Jack Zammattio
CEO & Co-Founder
Hephaestus [logo]

```
Dillon not only "got" the big picture of how our technologies differentiate us in the fusion industry, but he made several comments that only fusion specialists would even be aware of. At that point I was convinced that Dillon was cut from a different cloth, and I knew we would be lucky to have Dillon as a partner to Hephaestus.

Dillon has since contributed an amazing amount in terms of ideas, strategies, and connections that helped Hephaestus move forward by leaps and bounds.

### Chase Zimmerman
CEO & Co-Founder
PRIMITIVE INSTRUMENTS [logo]

```
Dillon is exactly the kind of investor every founder hopes to have on their cap table.

He is a true partner—pragmatic, thoughtful, and always willing to roll up his sleeves.

His background in engineering and finance creates a powerful combination of deep technical knowledge and sharp commercial instincts.

Dillon is often the first person I go to for advice and one of our company's strongest allies. We're excited to continue our partnership with his new fund.

### Oli Quie
CEO & Co-Founder
Innerworks [logo]

```
As a founding team, we immediately recognized Dillon's astute product perspective. He felt like a builder as much as an investor, deeply understanding the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.

Dillon pushes me hard as a founder to improve, yet he has built the trust that makes him my first call when facing concerns. With his ear to the market constantly engaging with other entrepreneurs and investors in our space, I would prioritize him in my financing rounds at all stages.

```
Dillon has been undeniably one of our most helpful investors, shaping our go-to-market strategy and making customer introductions.

Dillon has helped us understand how investors think and how to efficiently raise capital.

He is a great listener and understands the founder's perspective — he does everything he can to enable us rather than tell us what he thinks is best.

CEO & Co-Founder

Dillon has a unique aptitude for thinking through problems and challenges and boiling them down to first principles. This, combined with his ability to quickly familiarize himself with the technical nuances of different industry segments, makes Dillon a great sounding board and savvy mentor.

We have trusted Dillon for his reliable investor perspective on matters and have valued his advice highly in our decision making.
