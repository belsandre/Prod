## Executive Summary

Dirac is an early-stage manufacturing software company founded in 2023 that has developed BuildOS, an AI-powered platform automating work instruction creation from CAD files. The company raised $10.7M in seed funding from Founders Fund (Trae Stephens) and Coatue, with a strategic partnership announced with Siemens in 2025.

**Key Highlights**:
- Raised $10.7M seed (announced 2025) from Founders Fund and Coatue
- Strategic partnership with Siemens for PLM/EDA integration and distribution
- BuildOS platform converts CAD files to animated 3D work instructions
- Customer base includes aerospace (Ancra Aircraft, Van's), defense (Blue Origin/Honeybee), and industrial companies
- Ancra Aircraft case study shows 95% time savings (3 days → 2 hours for work instruction creation)
- Fully in-person team based in Empire State Building, NYC
- CEO has Johns Hopkins robotics background and Northrop Grumman manufacturing experience

**Major Inconsistencies / Red Flags**:
1. **FUNDING DISCREPANCY**: Dataroom states "$6M seed (April 2024)" but public announcement shows "$10.7M seed" (2025). Seed round may have expanded or dataroom was based on early information.
2. **CUSTOMER CLAIMS UNVERIFIED**: Dataroom claims "pilots with Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin" but NO public evidence found. Company website lists different customers (Ancra, Van's, Blue Origin, Siemens, etc.) without mentioning these three.
3. **VALUATION UNCLEAR**: Dataroom shows $26.7M post-money valuation (Excel Dec-24E) but seed round valuation not disclosed publicly.

**Overall Assessment**: Strong value proposition addressing real manufacturing pain point (manual work instruction creation). High-quality investors (Founders Fund/Trae Stephens, Coatue) and strategic Siemens partnership validate approach. Demonstrated customer traction (Ancra 95% time savings). However, dataroom customer claims (Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed) NOT verified publicly. First-time founder with limited prior operating experience. Market is niche but addressable within broader $20B CAD/PLM/EDA ecosystem.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Funding Amount Inconsistent with Dataroom
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (factual discrepancy)

**Evidence from Interested Parties** (Dataroom):
- Priority deals document: "$6M seed round (April 2024) co-led by Coatue & Founders Fund (Trae Stephens)"
- Investment: "$20,000 pre-seed SAFE (November 2023, $15M post-money valuation cap)"
- Excel valuation: "$26.7M post-money (Dec-24E)"

**Independent Verification** (Public Sources):
- PR Newswire (2025): "$10.7M seed from Founders Fund and Coatue"
- AlleyWatch (August 2025): "$10.7M seed led by Trae Stephens (Founders Fund) and Thomas Laffont (Coatue)"
- No mention of $6M round in public sources

**Analysis**:
The dataroom's "$6M seed (April 2024)" is NOT consistent with public announcement of "$10.7M seed." Possible explanations:
1. Seed round expanded from $6M initial close to $10.7M total (additional investors joined later)
2. Dataroom information was based on early/preliminary announcement before full round closed
3. Multiple closes: April 2024 ($6M) + later close(s) → $10.7M total

The $10.7M figure appears more authoritative as it comes from official 2025 PR Newswire press release with both Founders Fund and Coatue confirmation.

**Recommendation**: Clarify with founder (Fil Aronshtein) actual seed round structure, timing, and total amount raised.

---

### Finding 2: Dataroom Customer Claims (Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed) NOT Publicly Verified
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (absence of evidence)

**Claims from Interested Parties** (Dataroom):
- "Pilot programs with Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin" (priority deals document)
- "ARR run-rate and revenue trajectory" (listed as research focus)

**Independent Verification**: NONE FOUND
- NO public mention of Anduril, Stellantis, or Lockheed Martin as Dirac customers/pilots
- Company website lists 15+ customers but does NOT include these three names
- No press releases, case studies, or news articles mentioning these relationships
- No quotes from these companies in Dirac materials

**Verified Customers** (from company website):
- **Aerospace**: Van's Aircraft, Ancra Aircraft
- **Defense/Space**: Blue Origin (Honeybee Robotics)
- **Automotive/Industrial**: Siemens, LU-VE Group, Tesmec, Mueller Refrigeration
- **Other**: G&H, Spudnik, Boekel Scientific, Woolpert, Physical Intelligence, Fairlead, FC Dadson

**Analysis**:
The dataroom's claim of "pilots with Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin" is NOT corroborated by any public information. This is concerning because:
1. These are marquee defense/automotive names that would typically be highlighted in marketing if true
2. Company website lists many other customers but omits these three
3. No PR announcements mentioning these relationships

Possible explanations:
1. Pilots exist but are under NDA/confidential (common in defense sector)
2. Dataroom information is outdated or aspirational ("in discussions" interpreted as "pilots")
3. Pilots were initiated but didn't convert to contracts
4. Information is incorrect

**Recommendation**: Request evidence of Anduril, Stellantis, Lockheed relationships (contracts, LOIs, pilot agreements). If confidential, at least confirm existence and status.

---

### Finding 3: Strong Customer Validation with Ancra Aircraft Case Study
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (publicly documented)

**Verified Evidence**:
- Ancra Aircraft is a confirmed customer (listed on website + PR announcement)
- Ancra supplies cargo loading systems to 60% of global freighter fleet (major player)
- Documented ROI: Work instruction creation time 3 days → 2 hours (95% reduction)
- Quality improvements: decreased errors through standardization
- Operational impact: tacit knowledge successfully transferred to new hires

**Executive Quote** (from PR announcement):
Ancra representative confirmed results in official press release

**Analysis**:
This is the strongest evidence of product-market fit:
1. Real customer with verifiable identity (Ancra is established aerospace supplier)
2. Quantified ROI (95% time savings is dramatic)
3. Multiple benefits beyond speed (quality, knowledge transfer)
4. Customer willing to be publicly referenced (indicates satisfaction)

**Assessment**: Ancra case study validates core value proposition. If Dirac can replicate 95% time savings across other aerospace/defense customers, addressable market is significant.

---

### Finding 4: Strategic Siemens Partnership Validates Technology and Opens Distribution Channel
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (officially announced)

**Partnership Details**:
- Announced in same PR as $10.7M funding (2025)
- Integration focus: Dirac BuildOS + Siemens Teamcenter (PLM), CAD, ERP, MES
- Value: Bridges design (Siemens PLM) and manufacturing execution
- Siemens endorsement: "Dirac has built the first and only automated work instruction platform" (Tomás Klausing, Siemens Director for Technology Partnerships)

**Strategic Implications**:
1. **Validation**: Siemens partnership validates technology approach (Siemens is $100B+ industrial software giant)
2. **Distribution**: Access to Siemens' massive enterprise customer base
3. **Integration**: Deep PLM/CAD integration enables enterprise-wide deployment
4. **Competitive Moat**: Siemens partnership may create barriers for competitors

**Assessment**: This partnership is highly significant. Siemens has immense distribution power in manufacturing software and rarely partners with early-stage startups unless technology is compelling. This substantially de-risks go-to-market and customer acquisition.

### Finding 5: CEO Fil Aronshtein Has Domain Expertise But Limited Operating Experience
**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Strengths** (Verified):
- Johns Hopkins B.S. Electrical Engineering (2021), M.S. Robotics (2022)
- Northrop Grumman Hardware Engineer (2020-2021) - firsthand manufacturing experience
- MIT Lincoln Laboratory research experience
- Motivated by real pain points observed at Northrop (manual, legacy workflows)
- Successfully raised $10.7M from top-tier investors
- Secured strategic Siemens partnership
- Strong founder testimonial from Dillon Dunteman

**Weaknesses/Risks**:
- First-time founder (no prior company exits)
- Very young (graduated 2022, founded 2023 - likely 25-26 years old)
- Limited prior leadership/management experience
- No track record scaling companies
- Northrop Grumman experience was entry-level hardware engineer role (short tenure)

**Analysis**:
Fil is a domain expert founder who identified a real problem from firsthand experience. His Johns Hopkins robotics background and Northrop Grumman manufacturing exposure give him credibility. However:
1. Very early in career (2 years post-graduation when founded company)
2. Never held senior role before CEO
3. Unproven commercial operator

The strong testimonial from Dillon Dunteman ("sharp", "mission-aligned", "deeply cares about helping founders win", "incredible to have on our team") suggests:
1. Fil is coachable and values investor guidance
2. Dillon provided significant value-add (GTM partners, VC introductions, fundraise strategy)
3. Strong investor-founder relationship

**Key Question**: Is Fil building a strong commercial team around him (VP Sales, VP Marketing, VP Operations)?

**Recommendation**: Assess executive team composition, board quality, and advisor network. Look for experienced operators complementing founder's domain expertise.
