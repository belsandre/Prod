- Specific, quantified customer results (Ancra: 95% time savings)
- Strategic partnership with major industrial software company (Siemens)
- Customer willing to be publicly referenced (indicates satisfaction)
- Multiple executive quotes provide context

**Limitations**:

- Only one customer case study detailed (Ancra)
- No valuation disclosed
- No revenue, ARR, or other financial metrics
- Partnership details limited (no revenue share, integration timeline, etc.)
- "First and only" claim from Siemens needs verification

- Superlative language ("first and only")

**Verification Status**:
- Funding amount and investors: Verifiable through investor announcements

- 95% time savings: Company-asserted, customer-confirmed but not independently audited
