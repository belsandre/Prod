### Hyperion is the most rigorous early-stage deeptech VC

Dillon Dunteman was a top young investor at world-class $100B+ AUM private equity firm Vista Equity Partners [logo] from 2021 to 2025.

Dillon helped deploy >$1 billion into growth-stage technology companies at Vista.

Dillon's capability is supported by LP commitments and references from senior Vista leaders.

Dillon is now launching Hyperion on the back of a successful angel track record in deeptech.

We deeply understand business models, unit economics, and commercial value creation strategies.

We rigorously apply this lens to deeptech startups...

... and we do it better than any other early-stage deeptech venture firm.

### General Partner – Dillon Dunteman

Built a personal venture portfolio marked at 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR by spending his time outside of Vista supporting and investing in some of the best deeptech founders.

Backed market leaders across deeptech categories, such as Quantinuum [logo] in quantum computing, Figure AI [logo] in humanoid robotics, and Zap Energy [logo] in fusion energy.

Engineering background from Harvard [logo] and networks in each deeptech vertical drive ability to unpack technically complex startups, build deep relationships with founders, and deploy capital into the best startups.

**Personal Investments**

Humanoid Robotics: Figure [logo] - $39.5B
Quantum Computing: Quantinuum [logo] - $10.6B
Fusion Energy: Zap Energy [logo] - ~$1.1B
Advanced Semis: Normal [logo]
Agentic Cybersecurity: Outtake [logo]

**Harvard College**
B.S. in Mechanical Engineering

• Senior thesis on vision software for micro-robotic bees
• Quantum computing algorithm development
• Grid storage power systems
• Rowed Varsity lightweight crew after walking on as a novice

**Data Points:**
- Latest Valuation: $39.5B (Figure), $10.6B (Quantinuum), ~$1.1B (Zap Energy)
- Personal portfolio TVPI: 6.7x
- Personal portfolio IRR: 77%

MOICs and IRRs are net of fees and expenses. Valuation inputs for MOIC calculations include valuation caps on latest convertible note or SAFE rounds. Current Quantinuum valuation is based on recent secondary transaction in March 2025 but note that the last institutional equity financing round occurred in February 2024 at a $5.3 billion post-money valuation. Normal Computing investment is a share award (given in lieu of direct investment) with current value marked at the total award value and cost marked at the Seed valuation. Furthermore, certain investments were made in Mr. Dunteman's individual capacity and are thus not comparable to future fund investments. Refer to the Valuation and Performance Definitions for additional important information regarding performance. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

### Hyperion selects the best deeptech startups

We believe most deeptech investors become too enthralled by founder personas and technology narratives, overlooking business fundamentals that quickly disqualify non-viable startups.

Hyperion rigorously evaluates founders for both best-in-class technical backgrounds and robust business acumen, driving higher-quality shots on goal.

---

## Page 8

HYPERION Proprietary and Confidential

### We push highly technical founders...

When evaluating deeptech startups, we challenge technical founders to demonstrate robust understanding of:

1. Core business model and unit economics

2. Current market structure and incentives of major participants

3. Quantified product ROI to customers

4. Capital intensity, burn profile, and financing strategy

---

## Page 9

HYPERION Proprietary and Confidential

### ... then we accelerate them to be world-class business leaders...

Hyperion actively supports its startups, particularly in the first 12-18 months with:

Unit economics build | Commercial narrative | Detailed financial model

GTM strategy | Simplified tech explanation | Bottoms-up TAM analysis | Customer pipeline build

Positioning versus incumbents | Access to Tier-1 Seed and Series A VC firms | Talent referrals

Milestone-based fundraising plans | Early brand building | Access to alternative capital sources

Access to relevant government officials | Term sheet analysis and negotiations | Supply chain

Hyperion prepares technical founders for their Series A financings, which require a robust commercial story.

### ... and help unlock capital from generalist VCs

Generalist VCs have been hesitant to deploy capital into deeptech, given technical complexity and unfamiliar business models.

Hyperion makes deeptech business stories legible for generalist VCs, enabling founders to access more capital partners.

HYPERION Proprietary and Confidential

### AI is catalyzing underappreciated deeptech categories

**Enterprise SaaS Evolution:**
PC → Mobile → Cloud → Generative AI → AGI

AI models will eventually see step-function breakthroughs in reasoning and performance that will drive never-before-seen ROI for enterprises. This will drive accelerated momentum for AI-synergistic deeptech categories.

Deeptech is generally less competitive, with more reasonable entry valuations and diversified tech exposure, providing a better setup for excess venture returns than hyper-competitive enterprise AI-focused strategies.

**AI-Synergistic Deeptech Categories:**
- Quantum Computing
- Advanced Energy
- AI-Powered Robotics

### Home run scenario – illustrative 10x DPI returns model

**Portfolio Construction Table:**

| | Inv. Count | Avg. Inv. Size | Capital Deployed | Avg. Entry Post-Money Valuation | Avg. % Own. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fund** | | | | | |
| Pre-Seed | 17 | $0.50 | $8.5 | $12.0 | 4.2% |
| Seed | 10 | $1.00 | $10.0 | $30.0 | 3.3% |
| Series A | 6 | $1.00 | $6.0 | $80.0 | 1.3% |
| **Total Fund** | 33 | $0.74 | $24.5 | | 3.4% |
| | | | | | |
| **Co-Invest** | | | | | |
| Series A | 10 | $3.9 | $39.2 | $80.0 | 4.9% |
| Series B | 8 | $4.9 | $39.2 | $500.0 | 1.0% |
| Series C | 4 | $4.9 | $19.6 | $1,200.0 | 0.4% |
| **Total Co-Invest** | 22 | $4.5 | $98.0 | | 2.7% |

**Outcome Distributions:**

Count by Outcome: 0.0x | 20.0x | 250.0x | 600.0x

Exit Valuation: 0.0x | 20.0x | 250.0x | 600.0x

Dilution by Outcome: 0.0x | 20.0x | 250.0x | 600.0x

Cap. Returned by Outcome: 0.0x | 20.0x | 250.0x | 600.0x

**Returns Summary:**

| | Capital Deployed | Capital Returned | Gross MOIC | Gross DPI | Fee Impact | Net DPI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fund** | | | | | | |
| Pre-Seed | $8.5 | $120.4 | 14.2x | 0.0x | | |
| Seed | $10.0 | $125.4 | 12.5x | 0.0x | | |
| Series A | $6.0 | $130.5 | 21.8x | 0.0x | | |
| **Total Fund** | $24.5 | $376.2 | 15.4x | 12.5x | (2.5x) | 10.0x |
| | | | | | | |
| **Co-Invest** | | | | | | |
| Series A | $39.2 | $214.4 | | | | |
| Series B | $39.2 | $64.8 | | | | |
| Series C | $19.6 | $29.4 | | | | |
| **Total Co-Invest** | $98.0 | $308.6 | 3.1x | 3.1x | (0.2x) | 2.9x |

▲ Hyperion's upside goal is to generate a 10x DPI outcome for Fund I LPs. The illustrative scenario above to drive that outcome assumes 33 investments, 27 of which are pre-seed and seed. The model assumes 3 home-run outcomes and 3 other smaller exits to drive 10x DPI.

▲ The model assumes $24.5mm of the $30mm fund is deployed into startups. Assumes $6.9mm eaten by management fees and fund expenses, with $1.5mm of recycling from earlier exits to pay fees & expenses in the outer years.

▲ In lieu of a dedicated reserve strategy, investments at Series A+ will mostly be allocated to co-invest vehicles with preferred economics, allowing LPs to optionally buy increased exposure to the highest-performing portfolio companies.

• Certain performance data reported herein represent projections and are hypothetical. Hypothetical metrics rely upon various assumptions which may prove inaccurate. As such, you are cautioned against any reliance on such figures which are provided solely for general informational purposes.
• The track record and performance figures herein represent a subset of prior investments made by Dillon Dunteman and exclude investments that, in the subjective view of Mr. Dunteman, are not core to the Fund's strategy. For example, investments in digital assets have been excluded from this track record. Inclusion of all prior investments would result in materially lower performance.

**Valuation and Performance and Financial Definitions.** Throughout this presentation, various terms and calculations are employed. The following are definitions and explanations of the basis of calculation of performance numbers included herein (all numbers are based on unaudited financial statements as of the Calculation Date unless otherwise indicated):

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Carry, Fees and Expenses | Carried interest, management fees, taxes, transaction costs (including with respect to the disposition of unrealized investments) and other costs and expenses borne by investors in a Fund. |
| Calculation Date | August 31, 2025 |
| Exit Date | The date of first distribution or sale for realized or partially realized positions resulting in proceeds of at least 50% of the cost basis. |
| DPI / Distributed to Paid In | The ratio of money distributed to limited partners by the applicable Fund, relative to their contributions. |
| GAAP | U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. |
| Invested Capital / Cost Basis / Total Invested Capital | The amount invested by a Fund in an investment or in a portfolio of investments, as applicable. |
| Investment Date | The date on which the referenced Fund first invested in a company. |
| IRR | Internal rate of return. |
| IRR (Gross) / Gross IRR | An annualized percentage that represents a limited partner's gross internal rate of return (which does not reflect Carry, Fees and Expenses), calculated based on the amount invested, the amount of proceeds that were received or deemed received and the actual date of such investment or receipt. Aggregate portfolio Gross IRRs are calculated using the actual amount invested in each investment, the actual proceeds received or deemed received from each investment and the actual date of each such investment or receipt. Proceeds received are the aggregate of Realized Values and Unrealized Values. All Unrealized Values are treated as realized as of the Calculation Date (unless otherwise indicated) and are determined consistent with GAAP (as described below under Valuation). |
| IRR (Net) / Net IRR | An annualized percentage that represents a limited partner's net internal rate of return (which reflects Carry, Fees and Expenses). Net IRRs are calculated using the actual amount invested in each investment, the actual proceeds received or deemed received from each investment and the actual date of each such investment or receipt. Proceeds deemed distributed are the amounts that would be distributed to the limited partners in the event of a hypothetical liquidation of all unrealized investments, and after deducting the payment of Fees and Expenses. All Unrealized Values are treated as realized as of the Calculation Date (unless otherwise indicated) and are determined consistent with GAAP (as described below under Valuation). |
| MOIC | Multiple on invested capital. MOIC may also be referred to as the Multiple. |
| MOIC (Gross) / Gross MOIC | With respect to a particular investment or a portfolio of investments, the ratio of (i) the Total Value with respect to such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable, to (ii) Invested Capital for such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable. The Gross MOIC for an investment or a portfolio of investments is based upon carrying values, including carrying values of outstanding escrows and earnouts and realized values inclusive of the receipt of any items that offset fund management fees, and does not reflect Carry, Fees and Expenses, which will reduce returns and may be material. Unrealized Values are determined as of the Calculation Date (unless otherwise indicated) and are determined consistent with GAAP (as described below in Valuation). There can be no assurance that actual returns will meet or exceed current Valuations. |
| MOIC (Net) / Net MOIC | With respect to a particular investment or a portfolio of investments, the ratio of (i) the Total Value with respect to such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable (less Carry, Fees and Expenses with respect to such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable) to (ii) Invested Capital for such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable. The Net MOIC for an investment or a portfolio of investments, as applicable, is based on carrying values, including carrying values of outstanding escrows and earnouts and realized values, inclusive of the receipt of any items that offset fund management fees, and reflects Carry, Fees and Expenses with respect to such investment or such portfolio of investments, as applicable. Unrealized Values are determined as of the Calculation Date (unless otherwise indicated) and are determined consistent with GAAP (as described below in Valuation). There can be no assurance that actual returns will meet or exceed current valuations. |
| Ownership % | Reflects the fully-diluted percentage of outstanding stock of portfolio companies owned by the Fund (assuming all convertible securities are converted). |
| Realized Value / Realized Proceeds / Realized Capital | The total proceeds realized from the disposition of securities, the value of any stock distributions to the partners of the funds, the payment of dividends and the carrying values of outstanding escrows, and earnouts, determined as of the Calculation Date (unless otherwise indicated) and determined in accordance with GAAP (as described below in Valuation) plus the amount of dividends received. |
| Total Value | The sum of Realized Capital and Unrealized Value. |
| Unrealized Value | The value of portfolio company securities determined based on the estimated fair market value of such securities as determined in accordance with GAAP (as described below in Valuation). |
| Valuation | Unrealized values of securities shown herein, aggregate value amounts and the calculation of performance numbers (including for calculation of IRRs and MOICs) are unaudited. Unless otherwise indicated, when estimating the unrealized values of illiquid non-publicly traded securities, Hyperion uses last round pricing. The estimated fair value of securities will typically vary from actual amounts realized upon the disposition of those assets. There can be no assurances that the value determinations, or the assumptions and methods used to make those determinations, will prove to be accurate or reliable. Such valuations may turn out to be inaccurate and therefore may affect the calculated returns with respect to such securities. |
