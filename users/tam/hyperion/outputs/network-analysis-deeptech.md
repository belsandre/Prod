## Key Network Characteristics

### **Strengths:**

1. **Founder-Heavy (41%)**: 135/329 connections are CEO/Founder/CTO level - exceptional access to decision-makers
2. **Frontier Tech Focus**: Strong in the "next 10 years" technologies (AI, quantum, fusion, semiconductors)
3. **YC Network**: Multiple YC-backed companies (Butter, Inversion, Aqua Voice, Klarity, others)
4. **First-Degree Capital Access**: 4 investor connections at 1st degree provide direct fundraising channels
5. **Technical Depth in AI**: Not just founders but actual technical staff at OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind
6. **Emerging Sector Leadership**: Strong in categories that are still forming (fusion, quantum, AI infrastructure)

### **Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Big Tech Depth**: Only 15 connections at FAANG+ (4.6% of network) - most are 2nd degree
2. **Geographic Concentration**: Heavily SF/Bay Area, NYC (limited international deeptech)
3. **Company Stage Gap**: Few connections at scaled companies ($1B+ valuations) compared to early-stage
4. **Missing Sectors**: Minimal presence in advanced materials, nanotech, space infrastructure beyond SpaceX
5. **Relationship Depth Unknown**: 2nd degree connections may have weak relationship strength

## Comparison to Claims

Based on dataroom analysis from Harvard network verification, Dillon claimed access to "elite Harvard founder networks" and "PROD accelerator ecosystem."

**Deeptech network validates:**
- ✅ Genuine founder-level access (41% founders/executives)
- ✅ Presence in frontier AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind connections exist)
- ✅ YC network is real and valuable
- ✅ Strong in emerging deeptech categories

**Gaps remain:**
- ⚠️ Most valuable connections (OpenAI, Meta, Google) are 2nd degree
- ⚠️ Limited access to scaled companies
- ⚠️ Connection existence ≠ relationship strength

---

## Bottom Line

Dillon's deeptech network is **genuinely strong for early-stage deeptech investing**, particularly in:
- **Frontier AI** (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind technical connections)
- **Quantum computing** (multiple founder/CTO relationships)
- **Fusion energy** (CEO access at multiple startups)
- **Founder community** (41% founder/exec ratio is exceptional)

The network is **optimized for emerging categories** rather than scaled tech companies. This makes it highly valuable for sourcing pre-seed to Series A deeptech deals, but less useful for accessing established unicorns or FAANG+ companies.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Network strength claim appears **substantiated** for deeptech early-stage investing use case.
