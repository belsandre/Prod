## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Network Optimization:** The deeptech network is **optimized for early-stage sourcing and ecosystem access** rather than portfolio company support. Strongest areas are **quantum computing** (elite tier with Quantinuum founder) and **fusion energy** (CEO access across multiple startups). Weakest areas are **portfolio company relationships** (limited connections found at claimed investments) and **scaled company access**.

**Strategic Fit:** For Hyperion's **pre-seed to Series A deeptech focus**, this network provides:
- ✅ Strong founder access for deal sourcing
- ✅ Technical experts (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic) for diligence
- ✅ Investor network for co-investment and fundraising
- ⚠️ Limited portfolio company connections raise questions about relationship claims
- ⚠️ Emerging category focus means limited access to proven, scaled deeptech platforms

**Verification Status vs. Dataroom Claims:**
- ✅ **Validated:** Quantum computing network (Quantinuum founder connection)
- ✅ **Validated:** Fusion energy ecosystem strength (multiple CEO connections)
- ✅ **Validated:** AI infrastructure depth (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind technical staff)
- ⚠️ **Partially Validated:** Robotics network exists but missing Figure AI and most portfolio companies
- ❌ **Cannot Verify:** Most specific portfolio company relationships (12+ companies not found in network)
