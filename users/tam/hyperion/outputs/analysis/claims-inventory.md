## Narrative Arc

**How Hyperion tells their story:**

Dillon Dunteman's narrative follows a clear hero's journey arc with lessons learned:

**Phase 1: Foundation (2015-2019)**
- Harvard engineering education (2015-2019) with focus on robotics, quantum computing, energy
- "Realized by the end of my college years that technology investing was the best way to thoroughly express the breadth of my passions"
- Rejected by SpaceX hardware engineering team, pivoted to finance

**Phase 2: Early Win & Humbling (2019-2021 at Firmament)**
- "First venture investment that I personally sourced and underwrote was CQC" (March 2020)
- Emphasizes early success: "Successfully invested ~$660,000 in a generational frontier technology business at age 23"
- Acknowledges failures: "That early win... gave me completely false confidence, and 3 of the next 4 investments... were underperformers"
- Lesson: "Those formative two years offered many lessons, but most importantly, I had planted the seeds for my career in venture"

**Phase 3: Learning Discipline (2021-2025 at Vista)**
- Joined Vista in Sept 2021 "at the peak of the market" and watched "the broad market collapse shortly thereafter"
- Learned "discipline" from Vista: investing discipline, how to treat founders, adhering to fund strategy
- Deployed >$1 billion across 15+ deals, "spearheaded AI research and strategy"
- Started angel investing in mid-2022 with "nearly all of my personal savings from the last 4 years (~$300,000)"
- Built personal brand: "I never had the name of a venture firm behind me while I was angel investing, making it difficult to initially reach high-quality founders. However, this forced me to intently build my own brand and directly own founder relationships"

**Phase 4: Building Track Record (2022-2025)**
- Figure AI investment (April 2023) before massive Series B
- Zap Energy Series D allocation (~$140K)
- Dirac pre-seed → introduced to Founders Fund → Coatue/FF seed co-lead
- Normal Computing advisory role with equity award
- Portfolio: 6.7x TVPI / 77% IRR, outperforming top-decile venture

**Phase 5: Hyperion Launch (2025)**
- "Now halfway into 2025, I believe those timelines in areas like quantum computing, fusion energy, and advanced robotics now have line of sight into commercial inflection points"
- "The challenge will be to graduate from small angel checks to successfully writing over $1 million checks into the best startups"
- Named firm "Hyperion" after Greek Titan associated with "light and illumination" and "watchful, guardian-like figure"

**Key framing elements:**
- **"Early positioning since 2019"** - Frames narrative as prescient thesis development starting with Quantinuum
- **Selective transparency** - Openly discusses 3 underperforming investments and "completely false confidence," but doesn't name failed companies
- **Discipline narrative** - Contrasts self with "little diligence on mainstream opportunities, quick passes on businesses that were too technically daunting to diligence, and plenty of wasted time bragging (or whining) publicly on social media" from other deeptech VCs
- **Technical + financial rigor** - Emphasizes unique combination of Harvard engineering background + Vista PE discipline
- **"Most rigorous early-stage deeptech VC"** - Superlative positioning against competitors
- **Founder-first language** - "First call for founders," "over-deliver," "authentic relationship building," "guardian of capital"
- **Performance emphasis** - Highlights 6.7x TVPI prominently, compares to top-decile vintage funds, shows chart
- **Omits timeframes** - Letter says "early positioning since 2019" but first investment (Quantinuum) was March 2020
- **Consensus timing unclear** - Doesn't define when Figure AI or other companies became "consensus" vs "early"
