## Investment Focus Analysis

### Core Investment Thesis

Hyperion's investment strategy centers on **AI-enabled deeptech breakthroughs** where advances in machine learning and AI hardware from 2023-2025 have unlocked previously intractable technical challenges. The fund focuses on three core thesis areas:

**1. Fusion Energy** - Next-generation fusion reactors using AI for:
- ML-powered real-time plasma prediction and control
- AI-driven discovery of semiconductor and magnet materials
- Novel reactor designs (Zap Energy's sheared-flow stabilization, Hephaestus, Avalanche)
- Infrastructure players (Marathon Fusion)

**Rationale**: Fusion offers 4 million times the energy density of fossil fuels with no greenhouse gases or nuclear waste. AI advances enable practical fusion reactors that can compete on levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and capex per watt ($/W) basis.

**Source**: Deeptech perspectives.md, pages 2-3

**2. Agentic Cybersecurity** - AI agents autonomously handling security operations:
- Alert management and remediation automation
- Tools across security stack from SIEM to email/M-SOAR
- Zero-trust architecture (ZTA) and next-gen threat intelligence
- Hardware security

**Rationale**: Nearly 300K unfilled cybersecurity roles in U.S. (3M+ globally). AI agents can staff enterprise SOCs and create efficiencies in $36B+ managed security service providers (MSSP) market.

**Source**: Deeptech perspectives.md, pages 3-4

**3. AI-Powered Robotics** - Application-specific, full-stack robotics:
- Non-humanoid form factors with better task efficiency and unit economics than humanoids
- Fully integrated players (hardware + software) vs. software-only models
- Spatial AI models (vision-language-action) enabling broad behavior generalization

**Rationale**: Most AI robotics value will be in application-specific businesses. Full-stack players developing both hardware and software in tandem will have best products through tight iteration flywheels.
