# Hyperion Ventures Network Analysis

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-17
**Data Source**: [network.json](/_data/network.json)
**Methodology**: Analysis of Dillon Dunteman's 637 LinkedIn connections mapped to investment firms and deal flow patterns

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis maps Dillon's professional network to understand deal sourcing capabilities, VC relationships, and claimed deal flow partnerships. The analysis reveals a **growth equity-oriented network** with limited early-stage deeptech density and several **critical verification gaps** for claimed strategic relationships.

### Key Findings

1. **Network Composition**:
   - Total connections: 637
   - VC connections: 175 (27.5%)
   - Growth equity heavy: Vista (9), Insight (6), Coatue (3)
   - Limited deeptech specialist presence

2. **Critical Deal Flow Gaps**:
   - Tamarack Global: Only 1 connection despite "close relationship with partners" claim (Figure AI source)
   - Founders Fund: Only 2 connections despite claimed "friend" introduction (Dirac Series A)
   - Lowercarbon: Unknown connections despite Zap Energy co-investment

3. **Network Mismatch**:
   - GP claims "early-stage deeptech" focus
   - Network composition: 8.4% growth equity vs 8.6% early-stage VC
   - Vista (former employer) has 9x more connections than key deeptech partners

4. **Verification Priorities**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Tamarack relationship (Figure AI sourcing, $200M+ AUM deeptech firm)
   - **CRITICAL**: Founders Fund "friend" (Dirac Series A introduction)
   - **HIGH**: Lowercarbon partnership (Zap Energy, strategic filtering)
   - **HIGH**: 8VC "Central Hub" relationship (claimed filtering partner)

## Network Statistics

### Overall Composition

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Connections | 637 | As of 2025-11-17 |
| Connections with Firm Data | 466 (73.2%) | Identifiable employer/firm |
| Connections without Firm Data | 171 (26.8%) | Personal or unclear |
| VC/PE Connections | 175 | ~27.5% of total |

### Category Breakdown

| Category | Count | % of Identified | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Unknown / Uncategorized | 291 | 62.4% | Individual contributors, unclear roles |
| Multi-Stage VC (Series A-C+) | 66 | 14.2% | Largest VC category |
| Early-Stage VC (Seed, Series A) | 40 | 8.6% | **Mismatched with "early-stage deeptech" positioning** |
| Growth Equity (Pre-IPO, Late) | 39 | 8.4% | Vista legacy dominates |
| Private Equity (Buyouts) | 9 | 1.9% | Minimal PE presence |
| Limited Partners / Fund of Funds | 6 | 1.3% | Small LP network |

### Network Density Analysis

**Key Observation**: Dillon has nearly equal distribution between **growth equity** (8.4%) and **early-stage VC** (8.6%), which is unusual for a GP positioned as "early-stage deeptech specialist."

**Comparison**:
- Vista Equity (growth): 9 connections
- All Tamarack (key deeptech partner): 1 connection
- All Lowercarbon (key deeptech partner): Unknown

**Interpretation**: Network reflects Vista legacy (2021-2024) more than deeptech positioning. May indicate:
- Relatively recent pivot to deeptech (network hasn't caught up)
- Deal flow still reliant on institutional VC referrals rather than founder/technical network
- Early-stage deeptech network still being built

| 2 | Insight Partners | 6 | Growth Equity | Network, no portfolio overlap |
| 3 | 8VC | 4 | Multi-Stage VC | **Claimed "Central Hub" filtering partner** |
| 4 | HOF Capital | 4 | Multi-Stage VC | Network, no known portfolio overlap |
| 4 | Bessemer Venture Partners | 4 | Multi-Stage VC | Network, no known portfolio overlap |

| **Lowercarbon Capital** | Unknown | 2-4+ | Zap Energy co-investor (~$1.1B valuation), claimed "strategic filtering partner + co-investor," no visible LinkedIn connections |
| **Flagship Pioneering** | 0-1 | 1-2 | Claimed deeptech focus, zero meaningful network presence |
| **DCVC** | Unknown | 2-3 | Major deeptech firm, no visible connections |

## Strategic Relationship Analysis

### Central Hub Partners (Claimed)

Dataroom claims strategic "Central Hub" relationships for filtering too-early deals and accessing deal flow. Analysis below:

#### 8VC

**Claimed Role**: "Strategic filtering partner for too-early deals"

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: 4 (above average)
- Portfolio Overlap: Bedrock ($80M+ raised)
- Category: Multi-Stage VC

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **Partially Credible** — Above-average connection count supports relationship claim, but only 1 known portfolio overlap (Bedrock). Requires verification of filtering partnership.

---

#### Andreessen Horowitz (American Dynamism)

**Claimed Role**: "Strategic filtering partner"

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: 3 (average for top-tier firm)
- Portfolio Overlap: Foursquare (Henry Bellew connection, not Dillon)
- Category: Multi-Stage VC

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **Partially Credible** — Standard connection count for prestigious firm. No clear Dillon-sourced portfolio overlap. Henry connection raises question: Is this Dillon's relationship or Henry's?

---

#### Lowercarbon Capital

**Claimed Role**: "Strategic filtering partner + co-investor"

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: Unknown (not visible in LinkedIn data)
- Portfolio Overlap: Zap Energy (~$1.1B claimed valuation), Entheos (diligence phase)
- Category: Early-Stage VC (Climate/Energy focus)

**Assessment**: ❓ **Unverified** — Despite claimed partnership and meaningful co-investment (Zap Energy), NO visible LinkedIn connections. Requires verification.

---

#### Spark Capital

**Claimed Role**: "Co-investor"

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: 2
- Portfolio Overlap: Antithesis (>$80M raised), Garden ($7M+)
- Category: Early-Stage VC

**Assessment**: ✅ **Credible** — 2 connections + 2 portfolio overlaps demonstrates real co-investment relationship.

---

### Key Deal Sources

#### Tamarack Global — CRITICAL VERIFICATION PRIORITY

**Claimed Relationship**: "Close relationship with partners"

**Deal Sourced**: Figure AI (April 2023 Series A)

**Firm Profile**:
- $200M+ AUM
- Deeptech specialist (quantum, AI, robotics)
- Series C participant in Figure AI (verified via public announcements)

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: **Only 1**
- Expected for "close relationship": 3-5+ connections

**CRITICAL GAP**: Figure AI represents >50% of total portfolio value. If sourced through Tamarack relationship, this is the MOST IMPORTANT deal flow relationship in the fund. Yet only 1 LinkedIn connection exists.

**Questions**:
- Who is the 1 connection? (Partner, Associate, Analyst?)
- When was relationship established? (Before or after Figure investment?)
- Did Dillon source deal FROM Tamarack or invest ALONGSIDE Tamarack?

**Verification Required**: Interview with Tamarack partners to confirm:
1. Relationship depth and duration
2. Figure AI deal flow direction (Tamarack → Dillon or co-investment)
3. Other deal flow shared (claimed but unverified)

---

#### Founders Fund — CRITICAL VERIFICATION PRIORITY

**Claimed Relationship**: "Friend at Founders Fund" introduced to Dirac CEO (Nov 2023)

**Deal Impact**: Dirac Series A (Founders Fund co-lead with Coatue)

**Firm Profile**:
- $12B+ AUM
- Multi-stage VC (Seed to Pre-IPO)
- Deeptech/defense focus (Anduril, Palantir heritage)

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: **Only 2**
- Expected for "friend" relationship: At least 1 senior connection (Partner/Principal)

**Verification Required**: **This is the #1 most concrete GP value-add claim with specific, verifiable outcome**

Interview questions:
1. Who is the "friend" at Founders Fund? (Name, title)
2. When did relationship start? (Before or after Dirac opportunity?)
3. Founders Fund partner confirmation: Did Dillon make introduction or simply pass along referral?
4. Dirac CEO confirmation: What was Dillon's role in Founders Fund connection?

**See**: [verify-gp-value-add.md](/recommendations/critical/verify-gp-value-add/) for detailed verification plan

---

#### Coatue

**Claimed Relationship**: "Close relationship," "strategic partner," co-investor

**Deal Impact**: Dirac Series A co-lead with Founders Fund

**Network Evidence**:
- Connections: 3
- Role: Dirac Series A co-lead confirmed
- Expected: 3-5 connections for "close" relationship

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **Partially Credible** — 3 connections is average for top-tier growth firm. Coatue participation in Dirac Series A is verified (public announcement), but unclear if Dillon brought deal TO Coatue or invested ALONGSIDE Coatue institutional round.

**Question**: Did Dillon source Dirac and syndicate to Coatue, or did Coatue lead round and Dillon participated?

---

### Co-Investors (Portfolio Overlap)

| Firm | Connections | Portfolio Overlap | Overlap Count |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Spark Capital** | 2 | Antithesis, Garden | 2 |
| **8VC** | 4 | Bedrock | 1 |
| **Lowercarbon** | Unknown | Zap Energy, Entheos | 2 |
| **Coatue** | 3 | Dirac | 1 |
| **Founders Fund** | 2 | Dirac | 1 |
| **Tamarack** | 1 | Figure AI | 1 |

**Observation**: Most portfolio overlaps are with firms where Dillon likely invested ALONGSIDE institutional rounds rather than sourcing deals independently:
- Figure AI: Series A closed May 2023, Dillon invested April 2023 (1-month gap suggests participation in closing)
- Dirac: Series A led by Founders Fund + Coatue (Dillon participated)

**Question**: How many deals did Dillon truly source vs participate in institutional rounds?

---

## Network Gaps & Limitations

### Deeptech Specialist Firms (Minimal Presence)

| Firm | Expected Presence | Actual | Gap |
|------|------------------|--------|-----|
| DCVC (Data Collective) | High | Unknown/Low | Major deeptech infrastructure firm |
| Playground Global | Medium | Unknown | Early robotics/AI focus |
| Pillar VC | Medium | Unknown | Midwest deeptech |
| Trucks VC | Low-Medium | Unknown | Deeptech/infrastructure |
| Root Ventures | Medium | Unknown | Technical founder focus |

**Interpretation**: Network skews toward generalist multi-stage VCs (a16z, Bessemer, Founders Fund) rather than deeptech specialists. Suggests deal flow may come from institutional referrals rather than technical/founder network.

---

### Quantum Computing Network (Minimal)

**Claimed Expertise**: "120+ cold outreach to quantum computing industry" (CQC/Quantinuum sourcing)

**Network Evidence**: NO visible connections to quantum-specific firms or researchers

**Expected Firms** (if truly embedded in quantum ecosystem):
- Quantonation (quantum-focused VC)
- Quantum computing academics/researchers
- Quantum computing company founders (IonQ, Rigetti, PsiQuantum, etc.)

**Gap**: For an investor who claims to have sourced Quantinuum through 120+ cold outreach and positions as quantum expert, network shows NO quantum ecosystem density.

**Question**: Was Quantinuum sourced through quantum network or through Firmament institutional process?

---

### Fusion Energy Network (Minimal)

**Claimed Expertise**: "Fusion energy CEOs cite deep-dive blog post" + 4 fusion investments (Zap, Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon)

**Network Evidence**: NO visible connections to fusion-specific firms

**Expected Connections** (if truly embedded in fusion ecosystem):
- Commonwealth Fusion Systems connections
- TAE Technologies connections
- Fusion VCs (Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, Prime Impact Fund)
- Fusion academics/researchers

**Gap**: For an investor with 4 fusion investments and claimed thought leadership, network shows NO fusion ecosystem density.

**Question**: When did fusion investments occur relative to fusion article (April 2022)? Was network built before or after investments?

---

### LP & Limited Partner Network (Underdeveloped)

**Connections**: Only 6 LP/Fund-of-Fund connections (1.3%)

**Implication**: Limited LP fundraising network. Hyperion Fund I likely raised from:
- Vista Equity relationships (9 connections, former employer)
- Personal/family capital
- Small number of institutional LPs

**Concern for Fund II**: Weak LP network may limit scaling to larger fund size.

---

## Claimed vs Actual Network Patterns

### Claim: "50+ passive referrals/year ramping to 300+/year"

**Network Pattern**:
- 62.4% "Unknown/Uncategorized" suggests individual contributors, not decision-makers
- Early-stage VC connections (40) represent only 8.6% of network
- Founder/operator connections unclear (lumped into "Unknown")

**Assessment**: ❓ **Cannot Verify** — Network composition does not clearly support high-volume founder referral engine. Would expect:
- Higher founder/operator density
- More early-stage VC relationships (deal flow partners)
- Deeptech-specific ecosystem presence

---

### Claim: "First referral for founders in Hyperion ecosystem"

**Network Pattern**:
- No visible portfolio company founder cross-connections
- No spin-out company founder connections
- Unknown if Normal, Dirac, Quantinuum founders are LinkedIn connections

**Assessment**: ❓ **Cannot Verify** — Cannot determine from network data if portfolio founders refer other founders to Dillon

**Verification Required**: Reference calls with portfolio CEOs (Normal, Dirac, Quantinuum)

---

### Claim: "Top deeptech resource for multi-stage VCs"

**Network Pattern**:
- Multi-stage VC connections: 66 (14.2%)
- Top multi-stage firms: a16z (3), Bessemer (4), Founders Fund (2)
- Deeptech specialists: Minimal

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **Overstated** — Network shows standard VC connectivity, not exceptional "top resource" status. For comparison, a true "top deeptech resource" would have:
- 5-10+ connections per major VC firm (not 2-4)
- Inbound requests/mentions (not visible in static network)
- Speaking engagements, LP commitments from VCs (not verified)

**Question**: Are VCs seeking Dillon's deal flow or is Dillon seeking VCs' deal flow?

---

## Verification Priorities

### CRITICAL (Must Verify Before Investment)

1. **Tamarack Global Relationship**
   - Who are the "partners" with close relationship?
   - How was Figure AI deal sourced? (Tamarack → Dillon or co-investment?)
   - What other deal flow has been shared?
   - When did relationship begin?

2. **Founders Fund "Friend" Introduction**
   - Who is the "friend"? (Name, title, seniority)
   - Did Dillon source Dirac independently and syndicate, or participate in FF-led round?
   - Dirac CEO confirmation of Dillon's role in connection
   - Founders Fund partner confirmation of relationship depth

3. **Coatue Relationship**
   - Dirac deal flow direction (Dillon → Coatue or Coatue → Dillon?)
   - Relationship depth beyond single co-investment
   - Any other deal flow shared?

### HIGH Priority

4. **8VC "Central Hub" Partnership**
   - Verify "strategic filtering partner" claim
   - How many deals filtered to 8VC?
   - How many deals received from 8VC?

5. **Lowercarbon Partnership**
   - Why no LinkedIn connections despite co-investment?
   - Verify Zap Energy deal flow direction
   - Verify "strategic filtering" relationship

6. **a16z American Dynamism Partnership**
   - Verify "strategic filtering" claim
   - Is this Dillon's relationship or Henry's? (Foursquare overlap via Henry)

### MEDIUM Priority

7. **Quantinuum Sourcing Network**
   - Verify "120+ cold outreach" claim
   - Why no quantum ecosystem network presence?
   - Was this Dillon's individual effort or Firmament team?

8. **Fusion Energy Network**
   - When did fusion investments occur?
   - Why no fusion ecosystem network presence despite 4 investments + thought leadership?

---

## Summary: Network Assessment

### Strengths ✅

1. **Breadth**: 637 connections demonstrates active networking
2. **Vista Legacy**: 9 Vista connections provide growth-stage expertise and LP access
3. **Co-Investor Presence**: Connections to major VCs (a16z, Bessemer, FF, Coatue)
4. **Real Overlaps**: Spark Capital (2 investments), Lowercarbon (2 investments) show genuine partnerships

### Weaknesses ⚠️

1. **Shallow Key Relationships**: Tamarack (1 connection), Founders Fund (2 connections) for most critical deal sources
2. **Network Mismatch**: Growth equity-heavy network mismatched with "early-stage deeptech" positioning
3. **Missing Deeptech Ecosystem**: No quantum network, no fusion network, minimal deeptech specialist firms
4. **LP Network Underdeveloped**: Only 6 LP connections (1.3%) limits Fund II scaling
5. **Founder Network Unclear**: Cannot verify claimed 50+ founder referrals/year from network composition

### Critical Gaps ❓

1. **Deal Flow Direction Unclear**: Are relationships sourcing deals TO Dillon or FROM Dillon?
2. **Attribution Ambiguous**: Vista/Firmament relationships vs Dillon individual relationships
3. **Timing Unknown**: When did key relationships form relative to deal flow?
4. **Depth Unverified**: "Close relationships" and "friends" claims require validation

---

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Top 3 Deal Sources** (Tamarack, Founders Fund, Coatue) — See [verify-gp-value-add.md](/recommendations/critical/verify-gp-value-add/)

2. **Request Detailed Deal Flow Log**:
   - Source of each portfolio company (which relationship?)
   - Inbound vs outbound (did Dillon find company or was it referred?)
   - Timeline (when did sourcing relationship begin?)

3. **Reference Calls with VCs**:
   - Tamarack partners (Figure AI sourcing)
   - Founders Fund partner (Dirac introduction)
   - 8VC partners ("Central Hub" filtering relationship)
   - Lowercarbon partners (Zap Energy co-investment)

4. **Assess Network Evolution**:
   - Compare current network (637) to network at time of key deals (2020-2023)
   - Determine if deeptech network is growing or stagnant
   - Evaluate if Vista legacy is asset or liability for early-stage deeptech positioning
