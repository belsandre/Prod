# GP Analysis - Dillon Dunteman & Henry Bellew

**Analysis Date**: November 17, 2025
**Data Sources**: GP Bio, LinkedIn, dataroom testimonials, portfolio research
**Overall GP Team Rating**: **6.5/10** (Above Average, pending verification)

---

## Executive Summary

**Dillon Dunteman** demonstrates strong technical background, access to quality deals, and favorable investment timing. Two exceptional winners (Figure 94x, Quantinuum 6.7x) validate investment judgment. However, **100% of value-add claims are unverified** (all from dataroom only), with zero independent founder testimonials found in public sources.

**Henry Bellew** has **ZERO documented involvement** across all 14 researched companies, including winners with 94x and 6.7x MOICs. This is a **critical structural concern** about team capability, GP economics justification, and single point of failure risk.

**Team Dynamic**: Appears to be Dillon's solo fund with Henry in unclear role, NOT a true partnership.

**NO Public Validation Found**:
- ✗ Zero mentions in company press releases
- ✗ Zero LinkedIn acknowledgments from founders
- ✗ Zero podcast/interview mentions
- ✗ Zero public founder testimonials

**Implication**: Either:
1. Value-add is real but founders don't publicly acknowledge (unusual)

### Investment Track Record ⚠️

**Personal Portfolio**:
- **Claimed TVPI**: 6.7x net (77% net IRR)
- **Early-Stage TVPI**: 8.2x net (Pre-seed through Series A only)
- **Start Date**: "Mid-2022" per LP Letter
- **Capital Deployed**: ~$300K personal savings (~$1M total across 24 companies)
- **Average Check**: ~$42K

**Top Holdings**:
1. Figure AI: 94x MOIC ($40K → $3.76M) on $39B valuation
2. Quantinuum: 6.7x MOIC (verified) on $10.6B valuation
3. Zap Energy: Unknown MOIC (investment dates unknown)

**Verification Assessment**:
- ✅ Quantinuum and Figure valuations confirmed by Tier 3 sources (public announcements)
- ⚠️ Performance based on **unrealized markups**, not exits
- ⚠️ Small sample size (~$1M deployed) with extreme concentration (Figure >50%)
- ❓ Only 6 of 24 companies documented - cannot verify full 6.7x TVPI
- ❓ Holding periods unclear (IRR calculation not independently verified)

**Failed Investments** (acknowledged but not disclosed):
- "3 of next 4 investments in 2020-2021 were underperformers"
- "One company fire-sold for pennies on the dollar"
- "2 of 16 companies (15+ month holding) shut down"
- **ZERO companies named** - cannot assess failure modes

**Timing Analysis** ⚠️:
- LP Letter: "Began angel investing mid-2022"
- BUT: Quantinuum investment March 2020 (Firmament institutional)
- **Attribution Ambiguity**: Is Quantinuum personal or institutional investment?

---

### Thought Leadership 🕐 Timing Concerns

**Substack "Prescience" (tagline: "Precursor to Hyperion")**:
- Launch: ~2021 (exact date unclear)
- First article: October 2021 "Anticipating Disruptive Innovation" (pinned)
- Fusion article: April 2022 "Deep-Dive #2: Nuclear Fusion"
- Battery article: June 2022 "Deep-Dive #3: Solid-State Batteries"

**Timing Analysis**:
- Quantinuum investment: **March 2020**
- Substack launch: **~2021 (19 months AFTER)**
- First article: **October 2021 (19 months AFTER)**
- Fusion article: **April 2022 (but fusion investment dates unknown)**
- No robotics articles found **BEFORE** Figure investment (April 2023)

**Implication**: Thought leadership appears to **document investments retrospectively** rather than develop theses prospectively

**"Since 2019" Claim**:
- LP Letter: "Since 2019, I've purposefully built early positioning..."
- Timeline: First investment March 2020 (15 months after), Substack ~2021 (24 months after)
- **Zero 2019 timeline events** support claim

**Assessment**: ⚠️ Retroactive framing risk - narrative may be constructed after the fact

---

### Network Analysis ✅

**LinkedIn Connections**: 637 total, 175 VC (27.5%)

**Strategic Relationships** (high quality, modest connections):
- Vista Equity Partners: 9 (former employer, LP base)
- Tamarack Global: 1 (primary Figure AI source - **VERIFY DEPTH**)
- Founders Fund: 2 (claimed Dirac introduction - **CRITICAL TO VERIFY**)
- Coatue: 3 (claimed "close" strategic partner - **VERIFY**)
- Mike Annunziata (Also Capital): Described as "key mentor"

**Central Hub Partners** (strategic filtering):
- 8VC, a16z/American Dynamism, Lowercarbon Capital, Spark Capital

**Assessment**: ✅ Network appears **quality-driven** (strategic relationships) over quantity-driven (connection count)

**Concern**: ⚠️ Limited connections to key claimed deal sources (Tamarack: 1, FF: 2) relative to claimed importance

---

### Strengths (If Claims Verify) ✅

1. **Technical Depth + Commercial Instincts** (rare combination)
   - Harvard ME background + Vista growth equity experience
   - Can evaluate technical feasibility AND business model viability

2. **Access to Quality Deals**
   - Tier-1 co-investors (FF, Coatue, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Bezos) in 80% of tier-1 companies
   - Early timing (entered before 2024 mega-rounds)

3. **Investment Judgment**
   - Two exceptional winners validate stock-picking ability
   - Favorable timing on Figure and Quantinuum

4. **Relationship-Driven Sourcing** (if verified)
   - Tamarack (Figure), Firmament (Quantinuum), networking (Normal), VC referral (Dirac)
   - Not relying on inbound deal flow alone

5. **Hands-On Support** (if verified)
   - Hiring referrals, fundraising assistance, strategic advice
   - Advisory roles (Normal $80K equity award)

---

### Concerns ❌

1. **CRITICAL: 100% Unverified Value-Add**
   - ALL evidence from dataroom only (Tier 1)
   - ZERO independent verification
   - ZERO public founder testimonials
   - **Cannot validate differentiation thesis without verification**

2. **Funding Discrepancies Undermine Credibility**
   - Dirac: $6M dataroom vs $10.7M public (78% gap)
   - Normal: $17M dataroom vs $35M public (or round mismatch)
   - Natrion: GM customer claim **FALSE**
   - Dirac: Anduril/Stellantis/Lockheed pilots have NO public verification
   - **40% error rate** for verifiable claims (2 of 5 tier-1)

3. **Attribution Ambiguity**
   - Vista $1B+ deployment: Individual vs team unclear
   - Firmament Quantinuum: Personal vs institutional unclear
   - Exits occurred after Firmament departure (timing issues)

4. **Retroactive Framing**
   - Thought leadership launched AFTER first investment
   - "Since 2019" claim not supported by timeline
   - Substack tagline "Precursor to Hyperion" may be added retroactively

5. **Small Sample Size**
   - ~$1M deployed across 24 companies
   - Extreme concentration (Figure >50%)
   - Only 2-3 years of personal investing (insufficient track record)

6. **Selective Transparency**
   - Acknowledges failures but doesn't name them
   - Only 6 of 24 companies documented
   - Cannot assess failure modes or lessons learned

---

### Dillon Assessment: **7.5/10** (Conditional)

**IF Value-Add Claims Verify**: **8.5/10**
- Strong technical and commercial background
- Access to quality deals via relationships
- Hands-on support that founders value
- Two exceptional winners validate judgment

**IF Value-Add Claims Fail**: **5.5/10**
- Opportunistic timing in bull market (luck not skill)
- No differentiation beyond access
- Dataroom credibility compromised
- Cannot justify "better than other VCs" positioning

**Current Rating (Pending Verification)**: **7.5/10**
- Strong technical background ✅
- Access to quality deals ✅
- Favorable timing ✅
- BUT: Unverified value-add ❌
- BUT: Funding discrepancies ❌
- BUT: Small sample size ⚠️

- No testimonials
- No quotes
- No acknowledgments

**External Mentions**: **ZERO**
- No press mentions
- No LinkedIn portfolio posts
- No founder acknowledgments

**Assessment**: ❌ **CRITICAL RED FLAG** - Complete absence from portfolio work

---

### The Henry Problem

**For a General Partner to show ZERO portfolio involvement is highly unusual**

**Typical VC Fund Expectations**:
- Both GPs engage with portfolio companies
- Clear division of labor (e.g., sourcing vs operations, sector specialization)
- Team redundancy for coverage and support

**Hyperion Reality**:
- Dillon: 64% involvement (9/14 companies)
- Henry: 0% involvement (0/14 companies)
- **Single GP carrying all portfolio work**

**Critical Questions**:
1. What is Henry's actual role and contribution?
2. How is Henry's GP economics justified?
3. Why zero involvement in 94x and 6.7x winners?
4. Is this intentional design or neglect?
5. What happens if Dillon is unavailable?

---

### Possible Explanations

**Scenario 1: Non-Portfolio Role** ⚠️
- Henry focuses on operations, LP relations, fundraising (not portfolio)
- Dillon handles all portfolio work
- Division of labor is intentional

**If True**:
- Henry should have documented contributions (LP relationships, operational systems)
- Economics should reflect non-operational role
- Fund should be positioned as "Dillon handles portfolio, Henry handles firm"

**Assessment**: Acceptable IF evidence of value contribution in other areas

---

**Scenario 2: Junior Partner Learning** ⚠️
- Henry is 2 years post-grad, learning the business
- Plan for Henry to ramp up portfolio work as he gains experience
- Dillon is mentor, Henry is apprentice

**If True**:
- Should be reflected in economics (junior carry, not equal GP)
- Clear development plan with milestones
- Fund II should have different structure

**Assessment**: Acceptable IF development plan exists and economics reflect seniority gap

---

**Scenario 3: Credential Partner** ⚠️
- Henry brought on for Harvard network, Raine relationships
- Provides strategic advice and network access as needed
- Not expected to do day-to-day work

**If True**:
- Network should have demonstrable value (LP intros, deal flow)
- Economics should reflect this (lower carry than Dillon)
- LPs should understand this structure

**Assessment**: Concerning but possibly acceptable IF network value demonstrated

---

**Scenario 4: No Meaningful Role** ❌
- Henry has no clear contribution
- No portfolio involvement, no operational role, no network value
- Effectively a non-contributing partner

**If True**:
- Major red flag for governance and alignment
- GP economics not justified by contribution
- Misrepresentation to LPs (fund presented as team, reality is solo)

**Assessment**: **UNACCEPTABLE** - Recommend **PASS** if this scenario

---

### Henry Assessment: **Unknown / Requires Urgent Clarification**

**Cannot Rate Without Understanding Role**

**Verification Priority**: **URGENT**
- Interview both GPs to understand division of labor
- Request documentation of Henry's contributions
- Assess whether zero portfolio involvement is intentional or problematic

**See**: [Clarify Henry Role Recommendation](../recommendations/critical/clarify-henry-role.md)

---

## GP Team Assessment

### Team Dynamics ⚠️

**Coverage**:
- Dillon: 64% of companies
- Henry: 0% of companies
- **Single point of failure**: Dillon only

**Redundancy**: ❌ **NONE**
- No backup GP for founder relationships
- No alternative strategic advisor
- Fund operations dependent on one person

**Partnership**: ❓ **UNCLEAR**
- Appears to be Dillon's solo fund with Henry in unclear role
- Not a true partnership (one GP doing all work)

---

### Value Concentration Risk ❌

**Portfolio Value**:
- Figure AI: >50% (single company)
- Dillon: 100% of GP portfolio work
- **Double concentration**: Single company + Single GP

**Risk**: If Dillon unavailable (illness, departure, conflict):
- Who supports portfolio companies?
- Who makes investment decisions?
- Who maintains founder relationships?

---

### GP Economics Alignment ❓

**Standard GP Structure**: Both GPs receive:
- Management fees (2% of AUM)
- Carried interest (20% of profits)
- Split per partnership agreement

**If Henry contributes zero portfolio value**:
- How is his economics justified?
- Are LPs paying for non-contributing partner?
- Does this create misalignment?

**Requires Clarification**: GP economics split relative to contribution

---

### Overall GP Team Rating: **5/10** (Concerning)

**Breakdown**:
- Dillon (Solo): 7.5/10 (pending verification)
- Henry (Absent): Unknown (requires clarification)
- Team Dynamic: 3/10 (single point of failure, no redundancy)
- Value Concentration: 2/10 (extreme risk)

**Critical Concerns**:
1. Henry's zero involvement is major red flag
2. Team lacks redundancy and coverage
3. Single GP carrying all work (operational risk)
4. GP economics may not align with contribution
5. Fund positioned as "team" but operates as solo

---
