# Hyperion Ventures: Objective Timeline

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-17
**Data Source**: [timeline.json](/_data/timeline.json)
**Coverage**: 2015 to 2025-09 (47 events)
**Methodology**: Cross-referenced public sources (Tier 3), affiliated sources (Tier 2), and dataroom claims (Tier 1)

## Executive Summary

This chronological timeline reconstructs the development of Dillon Dunteman's investment career, network, and portfolio from Harvard graduation (2015) through present day (2025). The timeline reveals several **critical timing patterns** that challenge key marketing narratives:

### Key Findings

1. **Retroactive Framing Risk**: Thought leadership (Substack) launched ~2021, **19 months AFTER** first investment (Quantinuum March 2020), suggesting narrative constructed around early wins rather than prospective thesis development

2. **Compressed Timeline**: Most portfolio investments occurred in 2023, immediately **before** 2024 mega-rounds (Figure $2.6B, Quantinuum $5.3B), not years ahead of consensus

3. **Attribution Ambiguity**: Quantinuum investment occurred during Firmament tenure (institutional), but claimed as "personal" angel investment. LP Letter says "began angel investing mid-2022" (2+ years later).

4. **Fusion Timeline Gap**: Fusion article (April 2022) timing unclear relative to 4 fusion investments — cannot verify if thought leadership preceded or followed investments

5. **Missing Data**: Only 6 of 24 portfolio companies (25%) have timeline events. Fusion investments, failed investments, and 12 other companies lack dates.

**Details** (from dataroom):
- "Systematic quantum industry outreach"
- "Cold-emailed/called 120+ quantum founders"
- Sourcing story for Quantinuum

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified — No timeline events, no public mentions, no founder testimonials

**Question**: Was this Dillon's individual initiative or Firmament institutional process?

---

#### **2020-early**: Connection with Ilyas Khan (CQC CEO)

**Details**: Initial relationship building for Quantinuum investment

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ⚠️ Partial — Relationship exists but no independent verification of timeline/sourcing

---

#### **2020-03**: 🎯 Quantinuum Investment — FIRST VENTURE INVESTMENT

**Details**:
- Firmament invests ~$660K in Cambridge Quantum (CQC) convertible note
- ~$20M round total
- Dillon's role described as "personally sourced and underwrote"
- Entry valuation: Not disclosed (estimated ~$244M post-conversion)

**Source**: Dataroom case study, LP Letter (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ⚠️ Partial — Investment exists, but individual attribution vs Firmament team unclear

**Critical Timing Note**: This is 19 months BEFORE Substack launch (~2021). Thought leadership followed, not preceded, first investment.

**Key Claim Linkage**:
- "First venture investment I personally sourced and underwrote"
- "Early positioning since 2019"

**Concern**: Attribution ambiguous — institutional Firmament investment or individual angel investment?

---

#### **2021**: Substack Launch — "Prescience" (Tagline: "Precursor to Hyperion")

**Details**: Thought leadership platform launch

**Source**: Substack archive (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**CRITICAL TIMING CONCERN**: Launched **19 months AFTER** Quantinuum investment (March 2020). This challenges "purposeful early positioning since 2019" narrative and suggests thought leadership was constructed **retroactively** around early win.

**Pattern**: Narrative appears to follow successful investments rather than precede them.

---

#### **2021-07**: Quantinuum Convertible Note Conversion

**Details**:
- CQC convertible note converts to equity at $244M valuation
- Dillon invests additional ~$76K pro-rata

**Source**: Dataroom (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

---

#### **2021-09**: Transition to Vista Equity Partners

**Details**: Growth equity role at $100B+ AUM firm

**Source**: LinkedIn, GP Bio (Tier 2)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**Key Claim Linkage**: "Deployed >$1 billion across 15+ deals" (financial rigor claim)

**Concern**: Cannot verify individual attribution at institutional firm this size

---

#### **2021-10**: First Major Substack Article

**Details**: "Anticipating Disruptive Innovation" (pinned post)

**TIMING CONCERN**: Published 19 months AFTER Quantinuum investment

---

#### **2021**: Fusion Research (Claimed) — TIMING ISSUE

**Details** (from dataroom): "Dillon originally started researching fusion energy in 2021 while at Firmament"

**TIMING PROBLEM**:
- Dataroom says "2021 while at Firmament"
- Dillon joined Vista Sept 2021 (LEFT Firmament)
- If "late 2021", Dillon was at Vista, not Firmament

**Source**: Dataroom (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

---

#### **2021-11**: Quantinuum Formation

**Details**: CQC merges with Honeywell Quantum to form Quantinuum

**Source**: Public announcement (Tier 3)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified — Major validation event, market leader emergence

---

### 2022: Thought Leadership Year

#### **2022-04**: Fusion Article Published

**Details**: "Deep-Dive #2: Nuclear Fusion" on Substack — comprehensive fusion article

**Source**: Substack archive (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified (article exists)

**CRITICAL TIMING GAP**: Fusion investment dates unknown (Zap, Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon). Cannot verify if article **preceded or followed** investments.

**Question**: Was this prospective thesis development or retroactive thought leadership?

---

#### **2022-mid**: "Began Angel Investing" (LP Letter)

**Details** (from LP Letter): "Investing nearly all personal savings (~$300K)"

**Source**: LP Letter (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

**CRITICAL TIMING CONFLICT**:
- LP Letter: "Began angel investing mid-2022"
- Quantinuum investment: March 2020 (claimed as personal investment)
- **2+ year gap**

**Implication**: Quantinuum may be **institutional** (Firmament), not personal angel investment. This would affect:
- "First personal venture investment" claim
- Portfolio performance baseline (when did personal investing truly begin?)
- 6.7x TVPI calculation

---

#### **2022-06**: Battery Technology Article

**Details**: "Deep-Dive #3: Solid-State Batteries" on Substack

**Source**: Substack archive (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**Note**: Demonstrates thought leadership breadth

---

#### **2022**: Figure AI Founded

**Details**: Brett Adcock founds Figure AI, self-funds with $100M

**Source**: Public sources (Tier 3)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**Context**: Company well-capitalized before Dillon investment (April 2023)

---

### 2023: Heavy Investment Year

#### **2023-Q1**: Robotics Research (Claimed)

**Details** (from dataroom): "Dillon began to dive deeper into humanoid robotics space"

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

**TIMING CONCERN**: Vague timing. Investment followed 1-3 months later (April 2023). Compressed timeline challenges "deep research" claim.

---

#### **2023-04**: 🎯 Figure AI Investment — MAJOR WIN

**Details**:
- Invests $40K in Figure AI Series A at $420M post-money
- Sourced through "close relationship with partners at Tamarack Global"

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ⚠️ Partial — Investment timing plausible, but sourcing/relationship depth unverified

**CRITICAL TIMING CONCERN**: Series A announced **May 2023** (just 1 month later). This **contradicts** "high-conviction, non-consensus early investment" claim. 1-month gap suggests participation **in institutional round closing**, not meaningfully ahead of consensus.

**Key Relationship**: Tamarack Global (deeptech VC, $200M+ AUM)
- Only 1 LinkedIn connection despite "close relationship with partners" claim
- Figure represents >50% of portfolio value
- **CRITICAL VERIFICATION PRIORITY**

---

#### **2023-05**: Figure AI Series A Announced (Public)

**Details**: $70M Series A led by Parkway Venture Capital

**Source**: Public announcement (Tier 3)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**Implication**: Dillon invested April 2023, Series A closed May 2023 = **1 month gap** = participation in institutional round, not pre-consensus

---

#### **2023-05**: Normal Computing Sourcing

**Details**: Dillon meets Normal Computing CEO Faris Sbahi at NYC networking event

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

---

#### **2023-10**: 🎯 Dirac Sourcing

**Details**: "Dillon introduced to Dirac CEO Fil Aronshtein by VC who passed on investment"

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)

**Details**: Invests $20K in Dirac pre-seed SAFE at $15M valuation cap

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

---

#### **2023-11**: 🔥 Founders Fund Introduction — CRITICAL VALUE-ADD CLAIM

**Details**: "Dillon introduces Dirac CEO to 'friend at Founders Fund'"

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION PRIORITY**: This is the **#1 most concrete GP value-add claim** with specific, verifiable outcome (Founders Fund led Dirac Series A).

**Questions**:
1. Who is the "friend" at Founders Fund? (Name, title)
2. Did introduction lead to Founders Fund Series A lead?
3. Dirac CEO confirmation of Dillon's role?
4. Founders Fund partner confirmation?

**See**: [verify-gp-value-add.md](/recommendations/critical/verify-gp-value-add/) for detailed verification plan

---

**Source**: Public announcement (Tier 3)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**Key Pattern**: Dillon invested **10 months before** mega institutional round. "Early" but not years ahead.

---

#### **2024-02**: 🚀 Quantinuum Raises $300M at $5.3B

**Details**:
- $300M raise at $5.3B post-money
- **21.7x increase** since July 2021 conversion ($244M)

- **Public PR**: $10.7M raised (Pitchbook, Crunchbase)
- **Co-leads**: Coatue & Founders Fund
- **Discrepancy**: $4.7M gap (78% error)

**Source**: Mixed (Dataroom + public sources)
**Verification**: ⚠️ Partial — Funding announced but amount conflicting

**RED FLAG**: 40% error rate on verifiable claims (Dirac -44%, Normal -51%)

**Verification Required**: See [resolve-funding-discrepancies.md](/recommendations/critical/resolve-funding-discrepancies/)

---

#### **2024-04**: Normal Series A — FUNDING DISCREPANCY

**Details**:
- **Dataroom**: $17M Series A (Drive Capital lead)
- **Public sources**: $35M total seed funding (Crunchbase)
- **Discrepancy**: $18M gap (106% error)

**Source**: Mixed (Dataroom + public sources)
**Verification**: ⚠️ Partial — Funding announced but amount conflicting

**Concern**: Systematic understatement of funding amounts suggests companies are later-stage than dataroom implies

---

#### **2024-H1**: Normal Series A Support (Claimed)

**Details** (from dataroom):
- "Financial model, diligence answers, term sheet negotiations"

**Source**: Dataroom case study (Tier 1)
**Verification**: ❓ Unverified

---

**Details**:
- Raises $1B+ at **$39B valuation**
- **15x increase in 19 months** (Feb 2024: $2.6B → Sept 2025: $39B)
- **92.9x markup** from Dillon entry (April 2023: $420M)
- Tamarack Global participates (relationship continuity)

**Source**: Public announcement (Tier 3)
**Verification**: ✅ Verified

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Figure represents **>50% of total portfolio value** at this valuation. See [figure-ai-deep-dive.md](/recommendations/critical/figure-ai-deep-dive/) for concentration risk analysis.

**Valuation Concern**: $39B for pre-revenue company is aspirational. Expected value analysis suggests ~$21B (46% below current mark).

---

#### **2025-09**: 🚀 Quantinuum Raises $600M at $10.6B

**Details**:
- $600M raise at $10.6B post-money

---

## Timeline Gaps & Missing Data

### 1. Fusion Energy Investments (4 companies, 0 timeline events)

**Missing**:
- When did Dillon meet Zap Energy CEO? (Claimed "relationship from 2021 onward")
- When did Zap Energy Series D investment (~$140K) occur?
- When did Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon investments occur?
- When did Zap become "consensus"?

**Significance**: **Cannot validate "early positioning" claim** in fusion without investment timing. Critical for determining if April 2022 fusion article **preceded or followed** investments.

**Question**: Was fusion thought leadership prospective thesis or retroactive narrative?

---

### 2. Firmament Exits (2 companies)

**Companies**: Envase, Logistyx

**Missing**:
- Envase exit (Jan 2023) occurred **16 months AFTER** Dillon left Firmament
- Logistyx exit (Mar 2022) occurred **6 months after** Dillon left
- When did Firmament acquire these companies? (During Dillon's tenure?)
- Dillon's specific role vs institutional team?

**Significance**: Attribution unclear — exits occurred after departure, challenging individual credit claim

---

### 3. Vista Deployments

**Claim**: "Deployed >$1 billion across 15+ deals"

**Missing**:
- Specific Vista deals Dillon worked on
- Dates of Vista investments
- Dillon's actual role vs team/institutional credit

**Significance**: Cannot verify individual attribution at $100B+ AUM firm with large investment team

---

### 4. Thought Leadership Timing

**Missing**:
- Exact date of first Substack article (quantum-focused?)
- Was quantum article published BEFORE or AFTER March 2020 Quantinuum investment?
- Was fusion article (Apr 2022) BEFORE or AFTER Zap Energy investment?

**Significance**: Critical for validating if thought leadership **drove investment thesis** or was **retroactively constructed** around wins

---

### 5. Other Personal Investments (18 of 24 companies missing)

**Note**: 24 total portfolio companies, but only 6 documented in timeline

**Missing**: Investment dates, sourcing stories, outcomes for 18 companies

**Significance**: Cannot verify 6.7x TVPI portfolio performance without full visibility. Unknown how many flat/down rounds, shutdowns, or underperformers exist.

---

### 6. Henry Bellew Events (0 events)

**Note**: No timeline events for co-GP Henry Bellew

**Missing**: ANY portfolio company involvement

**Significance**: Zero documented involvement across 47 events raises serious questions about team contribution, GP structure, and value-add. See [clarify-henry-role.md](/recommendations/critical/clarify-henry-role/)

---

### 7. Failed Investments

**LP Letter mention**: "3 of 4 investments in 2020-2021 were underperformers" and "one fire-sold"

**Missing**:
- Company names
- Investment dates
- Exit dates and outcomes
- What went wrong?

**Significance**: Cannot assess failure modes, pattern recognition, or lessons learned. Transparency gap.

---

## Critical Timing Patterns

### 1. Retroactive Framing Risk 🕐

**Pattern**: Thought leadership launched **AFTER** successful investments rather than before

| Event | Date | Gap |
|-------|------|-----|
| Quantinuum investment | March 2020 | BASELINE |
| Substack launch | ~2021 | +19 months AFTER |
| First pinned article | Oct 2021 | +19 months AFTER |
| Fusion article | April 2022 | +25 months AFTER |

**Implication**: Narrative appears to be **constructed retroactively** around early wins (Quantinuum) rather than prospective thesis development. Challenges "early positioning since 2019" claim.

**Red Flag**: No 2019 timeline events exist to support "since 2019" claim.

---

### 2. Compressed Investment-to-Consensus Timeline 🕐

**Pattern**: Most investments occurred **months** (not years) before mega-rounds

| Company | Dillon Investment | Mega-Round | Gap |
|---------|------------------|------------|-----|
| Figure AI | April 2023 | Feb 2024 ($2.6B Series B) | **10 months** |
| Figure AI | April 2023 | Sept 2025 ($39B Series C) | **29 months** |
| Quantinuum | March 2020 | Feb 2024 ($5.3B) | 47 months |
| Dirac | Nov 2023 | April 2024 (Series A) | **5 months** |

**Implication**: "Early" positioning exists but not years ahead of consensus. Most wins from **10-29 month** early bets, not multi-year conviction.

**Question**: Are these true "non-consensus" bets or participation in late-stage pre-institutional rounds?

---

### 3. Figure AI "Non-Consensus" Timing Issue 🕐

**Critical 1-Month Gap**:
- Dillon investment: **April 2023**
- Series A announcement: **May 2023**
- Gap: **1 month**

**Implication**: Strongly suggests Dillon participated **in Series A closing** rather than meaningfully ahead of institutional consensus. Contradicts "high-conviction, non-consensus early investment" claim.

---

### 4. Angel Investing Start Date Conflict 🕐

**Conflicting Claims**:
- LP Letter: "Began angel investing **mid-2022**"
- Quantinuum investment: **March 2020** (claimed as personal)
- Gap: **2+ years**

**Questions**:
1. Was Quantinuum institutional (Firmament) or personal angel investment?
2. If institutional, does portfolio performance start from 2022, not 2020?
3. If personal, why does LP Letter say "mid-2022"?

**Implication**: Attribution ambiguity affects performance calculation baseline.

---

### 5. Fusion Research Timing Contradiction 🕐

**Dataroom Claim**: "Dillon originally started researching fusion energy in 2021 while at Firmament"

**Timeline Facts**:
- Dillon LEFT Firmament: Sept 2021
- Fusion article published: April 2022 (while at Vista)

**Contradiction**: If "late 2021," Dillon was at **Vista**, not Firmament.

---

## Source Tier Distribution

| Tier | Events | Percentage | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Tier 1** (Entity-Controlled) | 22 | 46.8% | Dataroom, GP claims — lowest credibility |
| **Tier 2** (Affiliated) | 2 | 4.3% | LinkedIn, personal websites — medium credibility |
| **Tier 3** (Independent) | 10 | 21.3% | Public announcements, news — highest credibility |
| **Mixed** | 2 | 4.3% | Combination of sources |

**Key Pattern**: Only **21.3% of timeline events** verified by independent sources (Tier 3). Majority (46.8%) rely exclusively on dataroom claims.

**Critical Gap**: **100% of value-add claims** (hiring referrals, VC introductions, advisory roles) sourced from Tier 1 only with **ZERO** Tier 3 verification.

---

## Verification Priorities

### CRITICAL (Must Verify Before Investment)

1. **Dirac-Founders Fund Introduction** (Nov 2023)
   - Who is the "friend" at Founders Fund?
   - Did introduction lead to Series A lead?
   - Dirac CEO + FF partner confirmation
   - **Most concrete GP value-add claim**

2. **Fusion Investment Timing**
   - When did Zap, Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon investments occur?
   - Did April 2022 fusion article precede or follow investments?
   - **Critical for retroactive framing assessment**

3. **Figure AI-Tamarack Relationship**
   - Depth and duration of "close relationship with partners"?
   - Deal flow direction (Tamarack → Dillon or co-investment)?
   - Why only 1 LinkedIn connection for most important deal source?

4. **Quantinuum Attribution**
   - Institutional (Firmament) or personal angel investment?
   - Individual sourcing or team effort?
   - When did "personal angel investing" truly begin?

### HIGH Priority

5. **Normal Advisory Role** (July 2024)
   - Verify $80K equity award
   - Founder testimonial for value-add claims
   - Hiring referral validation

6. **Funding Discrepancies**
   - Dirac: $6M vs $10.7M (78% gap)
   - Normal: $17M vs $35M (106% gap)
   - GP explanation required

7. **Vista Deal Attribution**
   - Specific deals and role
   - Individual vs team credit
   - "$1B deployed across 15+ deals" verification

### MEDIUM Priority

8. **Substack Launch Date**
   - Exact date of Substack launch
   - First quantum article date vs Quantinuum investment
   - Timing analysis for retroactive framing assessment

9. **Failed Investment Details**
   - Names of 3 underperformers
   - Investment and exit dates
   - Lessons learned

10. **Other Portfolio Companies**
    - Investment dates for remaining 18 companies
    - Sourcing stories
    - Outcomes and valuations

---

## Key Takeaways

### What Timeline Confirms ✅

1. **Quantinuum & Figure AI Outcomes**: Both achieved stated valuations ($10.6B, $39B) via public funding announcements
2. **Education & Employment**: Harvard ME (2015-2019), Firmament (2019-2021), Vista (2021-2024) all verified
3. **Investment Existence**: Quantinuum (2020), Figure (2023), Dirac (2023) investments plausible based on subsequent funding rounds
4. **Product Milestones**: Figure 02 unveiling, Normal chip tape-out, Quantinuum Honeywell merger all verified

### What Timeline Challenges ⚠️

1. **"Early Positioning Since 2019"**: No 2019 timeline events support claim. First investment March 2020, thought leadership ~2021 (19-month lag).

2. **Thought Leadership Timing**: Substack launched AFTER first investment, suggesting retroactive narrative construction

3. **"Non-Consensus" Claims**: Figure AI invested April 2023, Series A announced May 2023 (1-month gap) — questions consensus timing

4. **Fusion Thought Leadership**: April 2022 article timing unclear relative to 4 fusion investments (no dates)

5. **Angel Investing Start**: LP Letter says "mid-2022" but Quantinuum claimed as personal (March 2020) — 2+ year conflict

### What Timeline Cannot Verify ❓

1. **ALL Value-Add Claims** (100% Tier 1 only):
   - Hiring referrals
   - VC introductions
   - Advisory roles
   - Strategic support

2. **Individual Attribution**:
   - Quantinuum "personally sourced and underwrote"
   - Vista "$1B deployed across 15+ deals"
   - Firmament exits (post-departure)

3. **Deal Flow Volume**:
   - "50+ referrals/year ramping to 300+"
   - "First referral for founders"
   - Portfolio spin-outs

4. **Failed Investments**:
   - 3 underperformers unnamed
   - Fire-sold company undisclosed

5. **18 Portfolio Companies**:
   - 75% of portfolio lacks timeline events
   - Cannot verify portfolio performance

---

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Top 3 GP Value-Add Claims**:
   - Dirac-Founders Fund introduction (Nov 2023)
   - Normal advisory role and equity award (July 2024)
   - Tamarack-Figure AI sourcing (April 2023)

   **See**: [verify-gp-value-add.md](/recommendations/critical/verify-gp-value-add/)

2. **Resolve Timing Conflicts**:
   - Request fusion investment dates to assess thought leadership timing
   - Clarify Quantinuum attribution (institutional vs personal)
   - Verify "began angel investing mid-2022" vs March 2020 Quantinuum

3. **Address Funding Discrepancies**:
   - Request GP explanation for Dirac (-44%) and Normal (-51%) gaps
   - **See**: [resolve-funding-discrepancies.md](/recommendations/critical/resolve-funding-discrepancies/)

4. **Fill Portfolio Gaps**:
   - Request timeline events for remaining 18 companies
   - Disclose 3 underperforming investments (names, dates, outcomes)
   - Verify fusion investment dates (Zap, Avalanche, Hephaestus, Marathon)
