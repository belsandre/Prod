## Joke

**问：为什么程序员总是分不清万圣节和圣诞节？**

**答：因为 Oct 31 == Dec 25！**

(October 31 in octal = December 25 in decimal, because 31₈ = 25₁₀)

---

## Translation
**Q: Why do programmers always confuse Halloween and Christmas?**

**A: Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!**

## Explanation
This is a classic programmer joke that plays on number systems:
- Oct 31 = October 31st (Halloween) but also 31 in octal
- Dec 25 = December 25th (Christmas) but also 25 in decimal
- In octal: 31₈ = (3 × 8¹) + (1 × 8⁰) = 24 + 1 = 25₁₀

笑话解释：这个笑话玩的是数字进制的双关，八进制的31等于十进制的25！
