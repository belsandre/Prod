# Podcast to LinkedIn Posts Workflow - README

## Quick Start

This workflow helps you generate 6 LinkedIn post variations from a podcast transcript using an LLM (like Claude Code).

**File:** `podcast_linkedin_posts.md`

## What You'll Get

From one podcast transcript, generate:

1. **Teaser Post** - Hook-driven announcement
2. **Key Takeaways** - Value-focused list
3. **Featured Quote** - Inspirational highlight
4. **Behind-the-Scenes** - Personal narrative
5. **Call-to-Action** - Conversion-focused
6. **Thread Starter** - Multi-part deep dive

## How to Use

### Simple 3-Step Process

1. **Get your podcast transcript**
   - From Otter.ai, Descript, Rev, or any transcription service
   - Save as plain text file

2. **Open the workflow document**
   - File: `podcast_linkedin_posts.md`
   - Contains 6 ready-to-use LLM prompts

3. **Generate posts with Claude Code**
   - Copy each prompt from the workflow
   - Paste your transcript when asked
   - Get customized LinkedIn posts
   - Save to your outputs folder

### Example Usage

```
You: "I need to generate LinkedIn posts for my podcast episode"

Claude Code: "Great! Do you have the transcript ready?"

You: [Pastes transcript]

Claude Code: "Perfect. Let me generate all 6 post variations for you..."

[Generates 6 different styled posts]

You: "Save these to my outputs folder"

Claude Code: ✅ "Saved to outputs/podcast_episode_2025-11-07/"
```

## Why LLM-Based Instead of Templates?

**Better Quality:**
- Posts are customized to your specific episode content
- Natural language, not fill-in-the-blank
- Adapts to your guest's unique insights
- Captures actual quotes and moments

**More Flexible:**
- Easily refine and iterate
- Adjust tone and style on the fly
- Request variations instantly
- Get creative angles you wouldn't think of

**Less Work:**
- No coding required
- No template maintenance
- Just paste and generate
- Works with any LLM

## What's Different From Other Workflows?

| Feature | This Workflow | Template-Based | Manual Writing |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Customization | High | Low | High |
| Speed | Fast | Fast | Slow |
| Quality | High | Medium | Varies |
| Unique Content | Yes | No | Yes |
| Technical Skills | None | Some | None |
| Iteration | Easy | Hard | Medium |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use complete transcripts** - More content = better posts
2. **Provide context** - Tell the LLM about your guest and topic
3. **Iterate** - Ask for refinements if needed
4. **Mix and match** - Combine elements from different variations
5. **Add your voice** - Customize the final output to match your brand

## Posting Strategy

### Recommended Schedule

Maximize reach by spacing posts throughout the week:

- **Monday**: Teaser (launch announcement)
- **Tuesday**: Takeaways (provide value)
- **Thursday**: Quote (midweek boost)
- **Saturday**: Behind-the-Scenes (weekend engagement)
- **Sunday**: CTA (conversion push)
- **Week 2**: Thread (evergreen content)

### Engagement Tips

- Post at peak times (8-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM)
- Respond to comments within first hour
- Tag your guest in posts
- Add episode artwork or visuals
- Put link in first comment
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags

## Customization

After generating posts, customize:

- Replace any generic placeholders
- Add your specific podcast link
- Adjust hashtags for your niche
- Match your brand voice
- Add personal touches
- Include guest tags

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need coding skills?**
A: No! Just copy prompts and paste your transcript.

**Q: Can I use this with ChatGPT or other LLMs?**
A: Yes! The prompts work with any LLM.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: About 5-10 minutes for all 6 posts.

**Q: Can I modify the prompts?**
A: Absolutely! Customize them to your needs.

**Q: What if I don't like the output?**
A: Ask the LLM to refine it - "make it more casual" or "add more specific details"

## Example Refinement

If a post is too generic:

```
"That's good, but can you make it more specific? Include the actual
data point Sarah mentioned about 40% growth, and use her exact quote
about timing instead of paraphrasing."
```

The LLM will regenerate with more specifics from your transcript.

## File Structure

After using this workflow:

```
